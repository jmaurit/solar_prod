	abstract = {The requirements to satisfy the energy needs of today without compromising those of future generations have forced humans to adopt rules that permit a better use of the available resources, of which the sun is an inexhaustible energy source. Amongst the energy sources that offer the possibility of exploiting the resources offered by the Earth, solar energy has acquired great strength. Photovoltaic energy has presented a major evolution and it is forecasted as being an important contributor to power generation and an alternative to other non-renewable energy sources. The high cost of solar electricity is today the main reason why electricity from photovoltaic systems has not been introduced in a more widespread way. In this context, the aim of this paper is the study and analysis of the decision criteria to be used when searching for the best photovoltaic cell, studying both the criteria that exert most influence or their manufacture (defined by quantitative and qualitative values) and the alternatives which will be the decision problem to be solved; each alternative will correspond to one type of photovoltaic cell. Thus, relevant information has been provided by three experts and the TOPSIS method has been used to aggregate all the information combined with the use of fuzzy sets which will model the use of linguistic labels in the process.},

	abstract = {Energy management problems associated with rapid institutional, political, technical, ecological, social and economic development have been of critical concern to both national and local governments worldwide for many decades; thus, addressing such issues is a global priority. The main of objective of this study is to provide a review on the application and use of decision making approaches in regard to energy management problems. This paper selected and reviewed 196 published papers, from 1995 to 2015 in 72 important journals related to energy management, which chosen from the “Web of Science” database and in this regard, the systematic and meta-analysis method which called “PRISMA” has been proposed. All published papers were categorized into 13 different fields: environmental impact assessment, waste management, sustainability assessment, renewable energy, energy sustainability, land management, green management topics, water resources management, climate change, strategic environmental assessment, construction and environmental management and other energy management areas. Furthermore, papers were categorized based on the authors, publication year, nationality of authors, region, technique and application, number of criteria, research purpose, gap and contribution, solution and modeling, results and findings. Hybrid MCDM and fuzzy MCDM in the integrated methods were ranked as the first methods in use. The Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review was the important journal in this paper, with 32 published papers. Finally, environmental impact assessment was ranked as the first area that applied decision making approaches. Results of this study acknowledge that decision making approaches can help decision makers and stakeholders in solving some problems under uncertainties situations in environmental decision making and these approaches have seen increasing interest among previous researchers to use these approaches in various steps of environmental decision making process.},

For this purpose, we simulate an agreement between the government, who pursues political prices (guaranteed prices) as low as possible, and the project sponsor who wants returns (stochastic cash flows) as high as possible. The sponsor’s decision depends on the positive or negative result of this simulation, the resulting simulated price being compared to the effective guaranteed price established by the country legislation for photovoltaic energy. To undertake the simulation, the CP model articulates variables such as ranges of guaranteed prices, technical characteristics of the plant, expected energy to be generated over the investment life, investment cost, cash flow probabilities, and others. To determine the CP metric, risk aversion is assumed. As an actual application, a case study on photovoltaic power investment in Extremadura, western Spain, is developed in detail.},

In order to more accurately predict the output power of the photovoltaic power generation system and reduce the impact of photovoltaic power generation on the power system, this study proposes a prediction model based on an improved firefly algorithm optimized support vector machine. The model introduces the linear decreasing inertia weight and the adaptive variable step-size in the original firefly algorithm that effectively improves the convergence speed and optimization ability of the algorithm. The multiple meteorological factors influencing the photovoltaic power generation were studied. Calculate the correlation coefficient of each meteorological influencing factor between the forecasted date and historical date to determine the training sample. The training samples were used to train the prediction model. The photovoltaic array output power in the sunny, cloudy and rainy days was predicted for the three weather styles using the trained prediction model. The results were compared the prediction results on the standard firefly algorithm-based optimizing support vector machine and particle swarm algorithm-based optimizing support vector machines. The proposed method showed that the mean absolute percentage error of the three-weather style prediction result is reduced by 1.66 and 3.30\% and the mean square error is reduced by 0.21 and 0.27 compared to other methods. This method is verified to predict the PV array output power more accurately.},

The procedure has also been used in other government procurements and appears to be applicable in a variety of project funding processes. The technical quality of each proposed applications experiment was summarized through the use of multiple evaluation measures, or attributes. These were combined into a single index of the overall technical quality of an experiment through the use of a multiattribute utility function. Recently derived results in measurable value theory were applied to derive an index of the overall technical quality of a portfolio of experiments. Budgetary and programmatic issues were handled through the use of constraints. This approach allowed the portfolio selection problem to be formulated as an integer linear program. Details of the application are presented, including a discussion of the data requirements and assessment procedure used. The portfolio selection procedure was successfully applied, and variations of it have been successfully used in four other solar energy procurements.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the capacity investment decision of a supplier who solicits private forecast information from a manufacturer. To ensure abundant supply, the manufacturer has an incentive to inflate her forecast in a costless, nonbinding, and nonverifiable type of communication known as “cheap talk.” According to standard game theory, parties do not cooperate and the only equilibrium is uninformative—the manufacturer's report is independent of her forecast and the supplier does not use the report to determine capacity. However, we observe in controlled laboratory experiments that parties cooperate even in the absence of reputation-building mechanisms and complex contracts. We argue that the underlying reason for cooperation is trust and trustworthiness. The extant literature on forecast sharing and supply chain coordination implicitly assumes that supply chain members either absolutely trust each other and cooperate when sharing forecast information, or do not trust each other at all. Contrary to this all-or-nothing view, we determine that a continuum exists between these two extremes. In addition, we determine (i) when trust is important in forecast information sharing, (ii) how trust is affected by changes in the supply chain environment, and (iii) how trust affects related operational decisions. To explain and better understand the observed behavioral regularities, we also develop an analytical model of trust to incorporate both pecuniary and nonpecuniary incentives in the game-theoretic analysis of cheap-talk forecast communication. The model identifies and quantifies how trust and trustworthiness induce effective cheap-talk forecast sharing under the wholesale price contract. We also determine the impact of repeated interactions and information feedback on trust and cooperation in forecast sharing. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our results for developing effective forecast management policies.This paper was accepted by Ananth Iyer, operations and supply chain management.},

	abstract = {The risk of supply disruption increases as firms seek to procure from cheaper, but unproven, suppliers. We model a supply chain consisting of a single buyer and two suppliers, both of which compete for the buyer's order and face risk of supply disruption. One supplier is comparatively more reliable but also more expensive, whereas the other one is less reliable but cheaper and faces higher risk of disruption. Moreover, the risk level of the unreliable supplier may be private information, and this lack of visibility increases the buyer's purchasing risk. In such settings, the unreliable supplier often provides a price and quantity (P\&Q) guarantee to the buyer. Our objective is to study the underlying motivation for the guarantee offer and its effects on the competitive intensity and the performance of the chain partners. Our model also includes a spot market that can be utilized by any party to buy or to sell. The spot market price is random, partially depends on the available capacity of the two suppliers, and has a positive spread between buying and selling prices. We analytically characterize the equilibrium contracts for the two suppliers and the buyer's optimal procurement strategy. First, our analysis shows that P\&Q guarantee allows the unreliable supplier to better compete against the more reliable one by providing supply assurance to the buyer. More importantly, when information asymmetry risk is high, use of a guarantee may enable the unreliable supplier to credibly signal her true risk, thereby improving visibility into the chain. This signal can also be used by the buyer to infer the expected spot market price. In spite of these benefits, a guarantee offer in an asymmetric setting may not always be desirable for the buyer. Rather, it can reduce competition between the suppliers, resulting in higher costs for the buyer.This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management.},

We use the bilateral monopoly setting to analyze six scenarios: three increasingly general contracts (wholesale-pricing schemes, two-part linear schemes, and twopart nonlinear schemes), each under full and incomplete information about the buyer's cost structure. We allow both sides to refuse to trade by explicitly including reservation profit levels for both; for the supplier, this is implemented through a cutoff policy. We derive the supplier's optimal contracts and profits for all six scenarios and examine the value of information and of more general contracts. Our key findings are as follows: First, the value of information is higher under two-part contracts; second, the value of offering two-part contracts is higher under full information; and third, the proportion of buyers the supplier will choose to exclude can be substantial.},

Changing facilities from net energy users to net energy producers is a major concern for supply chain managers who are interested in greening their business. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is an innovative design idea to achieve energy positive buildings. In a BIPV building, photovoltaic (PV) arrays are integrated into the structure of the building in order to transform the incident solar radiation to clean energy that can be used in facility operations. This option is dependent on the economic attractiveness of the solar PVs, which, in return, depends on the policies (incentives, subsidies, feed-in tariff) in effect at the facility location, the efficiency of the PVs installed, and the amount of incident solar radiation at the facility location. We present an economic model that calculates the cost per kWh capacity of solar PVs installed and then integrate the decision of installing PVs of different sizes on the facility rooftops of a supply chain subject to the different environmental policies available. We study the implications of our model based on a sensitivity analysis for different carbon credit prices, PV generation costs, and feed-in tariff prices.},

Focusing on the wine industry, the study first examines how GIs encourage quality by improving vertical adaptation and leveraging resources (e.g., knowledge) of all SC members. Second, it analyzes how co-ops' collective action and horizon investment problems may hinder the delivery of high-quality products. The paper also examines how the effectiveness of GIs in promoting quality is contingent on the ownership structure of agri-food chains. Data from 327 wine producers and quality scores for 1951 bottled wines are used to test the hypotheses. The results reveal that on average, the quality of wineries is positively associated with the adoption of the most stringent GIs. Second, although co-ops are negatively correlated with final quality compared to investor-owned firms (IOFs), this disadvantage is moderated when co-ops are certified under the most stringent GIs. However, these GIs are not related to wine quality within IOFs, suggesting that quality certifications are more effective when used within suitable governance structures.},

	abstract = {This study investigates how supply chain sourcing strategies are associated with product quality recalls. In particular, the research examines how make-or-buy decisions (i.e., outsourcing), the use of foreign suppliers (i.e., offshore outsourcing), the relocation of production to offshore markets (i.e., offshoring), and decisions to consolidate supply bases (i.e., the use of few vs. myriad suppliers) are related to product recalls. Product recalls are serious quality failures in supply chains with significant, negative impacts on firm performance. Product recalls are frequently connected to the globalization of supply chains. Globalization has, at times, promoted inconsistency in quality control and standards, leading to quality problems and failures. Data across multiple industries, with widely reported recalls, have been collected and analyzed using regression techniques. Our findings indicate that offshore outsourcing has a greater impact on recalls than offshoring without outsourcing; outsourcing domestically has the least influence. Outsourcing to a smaller supplier base may lead to fewer recalls at low levels of outsourcing. However, it may exacerbate the impact of outsourcing on recalls at high levels of outsourcing.},

It is then utilized to compute solutions to a spectrum of spatial price equilibrium numerical examples in order to explore the impacts of information asymmetry under different scenarios. The numerical examples, which are of quite general functional forms, reveal that, as the number of supply markets increases, the “anonymizing” effect leads to a decrease in the average quality. On the other hand, as the number of demand markets increases, the pressure to improve quality increases, and the average quality increases. Finally, we demonstrate that, after the imposition of minimum quality standards, the average quality at the demand markets increases and the prices also increase.},

Lately, it is widely recognized that regional energy planning forms a multi-actor and multicriteria problem. This is particularly true in the case of power generation in regions presenting high rates of increase in electricity demand, together with a significant potential of renewable energy sources, since several and often conflicting points of view must be taken into account. In this paper, the contribution of a Multicriteria Decision Aid method — namely ELECTRE III — addressing in such problems is investigated through the examination of a particular case study in a Greek island. Through the presentation of the procedure followed (identification of actors, selection of criteria, formulation of alternative strategies, application of the specific method and analysis of results and actors' reactions), an effort is made to highlight those aspects that are crucial in reaching a compromise in regional energy planning problems.},

We propose a novel modelling approach to support supply chain managers decide the optimal level of investment to improve quality performance under uncertainty. We develop a Poisson–Gamma model within a Bayesian framework, representing both the epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in non-conformance rates. Estimates are obtained to value a supplier quality improvement activity and assess if it is worth gaining more information to reduce epistemic uncertainty. The theoretical properties of our model provide new insights about the relationship between the degree of epistemic uncertainty, the effectiveness of development programmes, and the levels of investment. We find that the optimal level of investment does not have a monotonic relationship with the rate of effectiveness. If investment is deferred until epistemic uncertainty is removed then the expected optimal investment monotonically decreases as prior variance increases but only if the prior mean is above a critical threshold. We develop methods to facilitate practical application of the model to industrial decisions by a) enabling use of the model with typical data available to major companies and b) developing computationally efficient approximations that can be implemented easily. Application to a real industry context illustrates the use of the model to support practical planning decisions to learn more about supplier quality and to invest in improving supplier capability.},

Implicitly, we identify changing returns to scale, gains of diversification, and non-additivity. As these properties are often undesirable, e.g., for the purpose of accounting or in specific auction formats, we build on concepts from cooperative game theory to provide the Shapley value as the unique consistent reliability allocation rule. We then illustrate practical relevance and applicability of our approach for the case of wind power contributing to the reliability of Germany’s electricity system, and discuss how today’s reliability mechanisms may be improved by considering interdependencies between suppliers.},

The intent of this paper is to examine the difficulties that arise when trying to pursue a parallel strategy in the presence of multiple objectives. The basic elements of the problem include a set of projects, a set of objectives, the associated probability measures relating effort to success, budgetary and performance constraints, and a utility function defined on the range of outcomes. In the model it will be assumed that each project contributes to one or more objectives, and that the selection criterion is based on expected utility maximization. With this in mind, the problem is formulated as a probabilistic goal programme and solved with a heuristic that computes the K best funding schemes. Results are presented for a case involving the development of a non-petroleum-powered vehicle which demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm and the implications of the underlying decision rules.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to establish an analytic model that combines energy policy and the photovoltaic (PV) industry from the governmental perspective. We suggest that government decision-makers set a policy goal for the cumulated installed total quantity of grid-connected PV systems for a certain planning horizon. The objective of their mathematical programming is to minimize the system total average cost of feed-in tariffs (FITs) policy support and the learning investment per kilowatt (kW) PV system installed. In order to attain this goal, they must determine the appropriate FIT unit price and constant change rate that will stimulate residents of developing countries to install the PV systems rapidly. We also expect to achieve a learning effect through the accumulating experience in grid-connected PV systems that will reduce the system installed cost per kW each year. Our analysis reveals that the unit PV installed cost decreases with time and that the cost reduction is quite rapid when the change rate is large. To a certain extent, levering the magnitude of the change rate could affect the growth of the PV product life cycle. If governments in developing countries need to install a large quantity of PV systems at an early stage to reverse global warming or overcome the effects of climate change, then they must choose a higher change rate with a relatively larger initial FIT unit price to a FIT scheme.},

	abstract = {Expert panels are playing an increasingly important role in U.S. health policy decision making. A fundamental issue in these applications is how to synthesize the judgments of individual experts into a group judgment. In this paper we propose an approach to synthesis based on Bayesian hierarchical models, and apply it to the problem of determining physician staffing at medical centers operated by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA).Our starting point is the supra-Bayesian approach to synthesis, whose principal motivation in the present context is to generate an estimate of the uncertainty associated with a panel's evaluation of the number of physicians required under specified conditions. Hierarchical models are particularly natural in this context since variability in the experts' judgments results in part from heterogeneity in their baseline experiences at different VA medical centers.We derive alternative hierarchical Bayes synthesis distributions for the number of physicians required to handle the (service-mix specific) daily workload in internal medicine at a given VA medical center (VAMC). The analysis appears to be the first to provide a statistical treatment of expert judgment processes for evaluating the appropriate use of resources in health care. Also, while hierarchical models are well established, their application to the synthesis of expert judgment is novel.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider an electricity market that consists of a day-ahead and a balancing settlement, and includes a number of stochastic producers. We first introduce two reference procedures for scheduling and pricing energy in the day-ahead market: on the one hand, a conventional network-constrained auction purely based on the least-cost merit order, where stochastic generation enters with its expected production and a low marginal cost; on the other, a counterfactual auction that also accounts for the projected balancing costs using stochastic programming. Although the stochastic clearing procedure attains higher market efficiency in expectation than the conventional day-ahead auction, it suffers from fundamental drawbacks with a view to its practical implementation. In particular, it requires flexible producers (those that make up for the lack or surplus of stochastic generation) to accept losses in some scenarios. Using a bilevel programming framework, we then show that the conventional auction, if combined with a suitable day-ahead dispatch of stochastic producers (generally different from their expected production), can substantially increase market efficiency and emulate the advantageous features of the stochastic optimization ideal, while avoiding its major pitfalls. A two-node power system serves as both an illustrative example and a proof of concept. Finally, a more realistic case study highlights the main advantages of a smart day-ahead dispatch of stochastic producers.},

New information becomes available as time progresses. The manufacturer updates his belief on demand and/or spot price and subsequently decides the contract quantity. The demand and spot price are correlated. Thus, the new demand information also updates the belief on the spot price, and vice versa. We model the problem with an information updating Stackelberg game and derive unique equilibrium strategies. Previous studies have considered only the demand information and concluded that improved demand information always benefits the supplier. By contrast, we demonstrate that improved demand information benefits both the supplier and manufacturer if the correlation coefficient between the two uncertainties has a small positive value and benefits the manufacturer but hurts the supplier otherwise. Moreover, superior spot price information benefits only the manufacturer and always hurts the supplier. Surprisingly, superior information fails to improve the performance of the supply chain and only changes the allocation of the profits between the supplier and manufacturer. Our findings likewise provide insights into when the supplier intends to use the contract channel and which type of information updating facility or expertise to invest in if a choice must be made.},

The retailer then sells the final products to the market at a stochastic clearance price. We investigate a flexible price contract that allows the manufacturer to determine the product wholesale price, and the retailer to determine the order quantity, based on the future spot price of consumption commodities. Compared with the simple wholesale price contract, a win–win situation can be achieved under the flexible price contract when the manufacturer's postponed processing cost is lower than a threshold. However, under this flexible price contract the retailer may suffer from the commodity price volatility, even if she does not procure the commodities directly. We further investigate how the risk-averse retailer conducts mean–variance financial hedging by purchasing consumption commodity futures contracts. We formulate the problem using a dynamic programming model and derive a closed-form time-consistent financial hedging policy. Through numerical experiments, we show that the commodity price risk from the manufacturer to the retailer is effectively mitigated with the hedging, and the benefits of the flexible price contract are maintained.},

	abstract = {Prior studies on performance-based contracting (PBC) for after-sales services have highlighted its advantages over traditional resource-based contracting (RBC), when products are established and their reliability is known to all parties. We develop a game theoretic model to investigate how these insights are affected when the vendor is privately informed about the reliability of a newly developed product. A novel feature of our model is the interaction between reliability signaling (private information) and the vendor’s discretionary investment in spares inventory (private action), which arises naturally in the setting we consider. We find that this interaction leads to contrasting equilibrium outcomes under the two contracts: RBC induces the vendor to focus on inventory savings, leading to underinvestment in spares, whereas PBC induces the vendor to focus on reliability signaling, achieved through overinvestment in inventory. As a result, neither contract is efficient. We investigate two means to mitigate this inefficiency, but either approach has caveats: (a) making inventory verifiable removes the trade-off between reliability signaling and inventory investment, but results in diverging contract preferences between the vendor and the buyer; (b) pooling inventories across multiple buyers saves inventory costs but it also hinders reliability signaling, potentially exacerbating inefficiency.This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.},

The original firms compete with one another in terms of in-house quality levels and product flows, whereas the contractors, aiming at maximizing their own profits, engage in competition for the outsourced production and distribution in terms of prices that they charge and their quality levels. The solution of the model provides each original firm with its optimal in-house quality level as well as its optimal in-house and outsourced production and shipment quantities that minimize the total cost and the weighted cost of disrepute, associated with lower quality levels and the impact on a firm’s reputation. The governing equilibrium conditions of the model are formulated as a variational inequality problem. An algorithm, which provides a discrete-time adjustment process and tracks the evolution of the product flows, quality levels, and prices over time, is proposed and convergence results given. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate how such a supply chain network game theory model can be applied in practice. The model is relevant to products ranging from pharmaceuticals to fast fashion to high technology products.},
