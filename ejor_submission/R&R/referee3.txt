The topic of this paper is interesting but how to define solar panels are commodities, the authors need to address from the academic survey or the practice in working for supporting your viewpoints. The major comments are as follows:
1.	This article should explain the definition of the commodity. Then explain the relevance of the commodity definition and the results of this article.
2.	The abstract and conclusion need to be written more briefly and clearly what contribution of the manuscript you have.
3.	This article should define research hypotheses.
4.	The quality of the whole written text should be improved.
