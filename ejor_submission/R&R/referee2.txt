Referee 2

Comment:

The paper is an applied statistics paper with financial/economics background (something like financial econometrics).  The focus is on testing for properties of a market. As far as I can see, any decision making perspective is missing, which would be important, given that EJOR is an OR journal.  Moreover there seems to be no real methodological novelty in this paper. Just applying some more or less standard approaches to some question is not enough. (Maybe the paper fits better into some financial/financial econometrics journal, where the analyzed economic question might be seen as a novelty, suiting into the main topics of the journal)

Answer:

I thank the reviewer for his comments, and I take their criticism seriously. I agree that in my initial submission, I have not done enough to communicate both how my paper contributes to understanding decision making and fits into the broader operations research literature, as well as highlighting the methodological novelty in my article.

In page x, I have expanded the discussion around the implications of whether solar panels are commodities. In particular, I discuss the importance this has for procurement of solar panels:

  Determining whether a product is a commodity is of more than just theoretical importance. Historically, the commoditization of goods was a necessary condition for the establishment of sophisticated financial markets for those goods. A well-documented example: The invention of grain elevators for mixing and standardizing grain was a necessary precursor to the establishment of a futures markets with receipts of delivery traded on the Chicago Board of Trade \citep{cronon_natures_1992}. The abstraction between producer and end purchaser of goods was necessary for the functioning of these markets. A trader could fulfill a promise to deliver grain of a certain grade by simply buying it on the market or with cash settlement, rather than having produced it oneself.

  An important differentiating characteristic between solar panels is the quality of these solar panels. This can be measured as both the failure rate of these panels as well as the degree of degradation of the panels over time. If there were significant differences in quality between manufacturers, then this has implications for the structure and development of the solar panel market. Manufacturers with superior quality could differentiate themselves and extract a premium in the market. A reputation for quality among established manufacturers could also act as a barrier to entry, thereby reducing long-term pricing pressure.

  From the perspective of a purchasing manager responsible for procuring solar panels, whether panels can be considered a commodity or not is of great importance. If panels are known to be commodities with standardized quality and similar pricing, then the decision for purchasing manager is substantially simplified. They need only to decide on the observable form factor, for example dimension and capacity. In addition, purchasing managers responsible for large projects with long lead times could make use of forward markets to hedge price movements. On the other hand, if solar panels are known to vary significantly by quality, then the decision becomes substantially more complex and costly. Purchasing managers would need to weigh the price of panels against expected quality. They may also need to make use of specialized engineering firms that test and certify panel quality. Since the purchasing decision is likely to be linked to a specific manufacturer, the purchasing manager is subject to risks such as bankruptcy or other supply disruption associated with that firm.

I have also expanded the discussion of the hierarchical Bayesian modelling to include an extended discussion of its core usage in the operations research field and commonalities with my own research subject:

  As a solution, I use a Bayesian hierarchical\footnote{Sometimes also called multilevel modelling or random effects modelling} model estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques. Bayesian hierarchical models have long been one of the primary tools in statistical decision theory \citep{berger_statistical_1985}. This form of modelling is increasingly common in operations research and management science. One of the main advantages is superior out-of-sample predictive properties with data with distinct groupings.

  In the operations research field, Bayesian hierarchical models have recently become a common and useful tool in a wide range of applications. A common application is to incorporate expert opinion into quantitative decision models \citep{rufo_merging_2010, szwed_bayesian_2006, utkin_method_2006}. In this application, the Bayesian hierarchical model is flexible enough to aggregate the information of the expert opinions while also being able to explicitly handle and propagate the uncertainty in these opinions. Hierarchical models have also been used to identify default risk among lenders and improve credit scoring models \citep{liu_identifying_2015, bhattacharya_bayesian_2019}. In this context, the hierarchical Bayesian models are found to provide superior out-of-sample prediction for the censored sample of the data. Other operations research related applications include a fund managers portfolio selection problem \citep{soyer_bayesian_2006, bodnar_bayesian_2017} and conjoint analysis in operations management \citep{karniouchina_issues_2009, gensler_willingness--pay_2012}. A commonality among all these applications is the need to aggregate information from heterogenous groups without overfitting the data with many fixed effects.

In the concluding remarks I also add a short discussion about the methodological contributions of the paper:

  The use of Bayesian MCMC simulation techniques in this article also provides an illustrative example of the use and usefullness of a powerful emerging toolset. The Bayesian frameworks and recently developed software such as Stan provide major practical and theoretical advantages over many traditional statistical methods used in operations research and decision science. These methods and tools are also increasingly accessible to the practitioners. \citet{kruschke_doing_2014}, \citet{mcelreath_statistical_2015}, \citet{gelman_bayesian_2013} and \citet{stan_development_team_stan_2014} provide accessible and thorough introductions and guides.

Finally, in the conclusion I also discuss how the paper helps contribute to better decision making in the quickly expanding renewable and distributed energy industry: 

  This article should also be considered as part of a broader literature on the special characteristics of new distributed energy generation technologies. The energy investment behavior of home owners, farmers, and small cooperatives are bound to be substantially different than those of large, specialized energy companies that have traditionally done most of the investment in electricity generation. Understanding the quickly evolving energy and power industry requires taking into account informational and behavioral factors, and this is a rich field for further research in the field of operations research.
