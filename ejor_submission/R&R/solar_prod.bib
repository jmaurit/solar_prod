	abstract = {This article introduces a modified simulated annealing optimization approach for automatically determining optimal energy management strategies in grid-connected, storage-augmented, photovoltaics-supplied prosumer buildings and neighborhoods based on user-specific goals. For evaluating the modified simulated annealing optimizer, a number of test scenarios in the field of energy self-consumption maximization are defined and results are compared to a gradient descent and a total state space search approach. The benchmarking against these two reference methods demonstrates that the modified simulated annealing approach is able to find significantly better solutions than the gradient descent algorithm – being equal or very close to the global optimum – with significantly less computational effort and processing time than the total state space search approach.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we formulate in a game-theoretic framework three coordination schemes for analyzing DSO-TSO interactions. This framework relies on a reformulation of the power flow equations by introducing linear mappings between the state and the decision variables. The first coordination scheme, used as a benchmark, is a co-optimization problem where an integrated market operator activates jointly resources connected at transmission and distribution levels. We formulate it as a standard constrained optimization problem. The second one, called shared balancing responsibility, assumes bounded rationality of TSO and DSOs which act simultaneously and is formulated as a non-cooperative game. The last one involves rational expectation from the DSOs which anticipate the clearing of the transmission market by the TSO, and is formulated as a Stackelberg game. For each coordination scheme, we determine conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions. On a network instance from the NICTA NESTA test cases, we span the set of Generalized Nash Equilibria solutions of the decentralized coordination schemes. We determine that the decentralized coordination schemes are more profitable for the TSO and that rational expectations from the DSOs gives rise to a last-mover advantage for the TSO. Highest efficiency level is reached by the centralized co-optimization, followed very closely by the shared balancing responsibility. The mean social welfare is higher for the Stackelberg game than under shared balancing responsibility. Finally, under imperfect information, we check that the Price of Information, measured as the worst-case ratio of the optimal achievable social welfare with full information to the social welfare at an equilibrium with imperfect information, is a stepwise increasing function of the coefficient of variation of the TSO and reaches an upper bound.},

	abstract = {Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are here united in one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes – the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size ε and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter ε on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

	abstract = {Conjoint analysis has played an important role in helping make a number of operations management decisions including product and service design, supplier selection, and service operations capacity. Many recent advances in this area have raised questions about the most appropriate form of conjoint analysis for this research. We review recent developments in the literature and provide new evidence on how the choice between ratings- and choice-based conjoint models might affect the estimates of customer demand used in operations management models. The biggest systematic difference between ratings-based (RB) and choice-based (CB) parameters is consistent with the compatibility effect, i.e., some enriched attributes like brand name tend to be more important in RB models and some comparable attributes like price are likely to be more important in CB models. Still, there were reasonably small differences between choice- and ratings-based parameters. Parameter similarity was also seen in the lack of differences both in the choice share validations when the “keep on shopping” alternative was not considered and in the profiles that were predicted to maximize choice shares. This suggests that the two approaches will produce similar estimates of the relative importance of various attributes. In spite of demonstrated success with each method, several reasons lead us to recommend the use of hierarchical Bayesian choice-based conjoint models. First, the slightly higher individual hit rate validations give us greater confidence in predictive accuracy overall as well as an increased ability to target individual customers. Additionally, the greater ease of modeling both changes in market size and competitive reactions are attractive benefits of choice-based models.},

A simulation study and two field studies show that extreme response behavior in CBC studies, such that consumers always or never choose the no-purchase option, harms the validity of WTP estimates. Reporting the share of consumers who always and never select the no-purchase option allows for detecting extreme response behavior. This study suggests an individually adapted design that avoids extreme response behavior and thus significantly improves WTP estimation accuracy.},

Once this risk information has been quantified, managers and decision makers can use it to develop appropriate policies, design projects, and/or allocate resources that will mitigate risk. However, rare event risk information inherently suffers from a sparseness of accident data. Therefore, expert judgment is often elicited to develop frequency data for these high-consequence rare events. When applied appropriately, expert judgment can serve as an important (and, at times, the only) source of risk information. This paper presents a Bayesian methodology for assessing relative accident probabilities and their uncertainty using paired comparison to elicit expert judgments. The approach is illustrated using expert judgment data elicited for a risk study of the largest passenger ferry system in the US.},

The mixture cure model, one important branch of survival models, is also applied in the context of credit scoring, assuming that the study population is a mixture of never-default and will-default customers. We extend the standard mixture cure model through: (1) relaxing the independence assumption of the probability and the time of default; (2) treating the missing defaulting labels as latent variables and applying an augmentation technique; and (3) introducing a discrete truncated exponential distribution to model the time of default. Our full model is written in a hierarchical form so that the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is applied to estimate corresponding parameters. Through an empirical analysis, we show that both mixture models, the standard mixture cure model and the hierarchical mixture cure model (HMCM), are more advanced in identifying future defaulters while compared with logistic regression. It is also concluded that our hierarchical Bayesian extension increases the model’s predictability and provides meaningful output for risk management.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the spatial representation of market structure calibrated on actual or intended choice data. Previous models developed for that purpose accommodate consumer heterogeneity by estimating parameters for each consumer, typically using the method of maximum likelihood. This approach to heterogeneity avoids assuming any particular distribution of the individual level parameters across the sample, but leads to problems related to the consistency of the estimates, sufficient degrees of freedom, and the validity of asymptotic standard errors and test statistics. Of greater concern is the assumption of independence of the choice observations within the same individual. This assumption is necessary in a maximum likelihood (MLE) framework to make the estimation computationally feasible. However, the marketing and psychology literature (cf. Manrai, 1995; Tversky and Simonson, 1993; Kim et al., forth coming) demonstrates that dependencies among choice alternatives may exist, and negligence to take such covariance into account may lead to inconsistent estimates, reduced predictive validity, and incorrect managerial action. We develop a new multidimensional scaling (MDS) model that estimates spatial market structures from pick-any/J choice data, provides for individual level parameters, and allows for correlations among the choice alternatives across individuals. We provide a Bayesian estimation method that overcomes the traditional problems associated with estimating models with such correlated alternatives. We provide an application to pick-any/J data for various brands of portable telephones. In a comparative analysis, we show that the proposed model outperforms one in which the utilities are assumed to be uncorrelated across choice alternatives.},

Germany has aggressive plans for wind power expansion, and pumped storage ramps quickly enough to smooth wind power and could profit from arbitrage on the short-term price fluctuations wind power strengthens. We consider five capacity alternatives for a pumped storage facility in Norway that practices arbitrage in the German spot market. Price forecasts given increased wind capacity are used to calculate profit-maximizing production schedules and annual revenue streams. Real options theory is used to value the investment opportunity, since unlike net present value, it accounts for uncertainty and intertemporal choice. Results show that the optimal investment strategy under the base scenario is to invest in the largest available plant approximately eight years into the option lifetime.},

If the current electricity price is below this limit it is never optimal to invest, but above this limit investment is made according to the function for optimal size. The connection between the real option and the physical properties of a small hydropower plant is dealt with using a spreadsheet model that performs a technical simulation of the production in a plant, based on all the important choices for such a plant. The main results of the spreadsheet are simulated production size and the investment costs, which are in turn used for finding the value of the real option and the price limit. The method is illustrated on three different Norwegian small hydropower projects.},

The main purpose is to examine investment behavior under the most extensively employed support schemes, namely, feed-in tariffs and renewable energy certificate trading. We consider both multiple sources of uncertainty under each support scheme and uncertainty with respect to any change of support scheme, and we obtain both analytical (when possible) and numerical solutions. In a Nordic case study based on wind power, we find that the feed-in tariff encourages earlier investment. Nevertheless, as investment has been undertaken, renewable energy certificate trading creates incentives for larger projects. In our baseline scenario and taking the fixed feed-in tariff as a base, the revenue required to trigger investments is 61\% higher with renewable certificates. At the same time, investment capacity is 61\% higher.},

We investigate whether agency costs between the lessor and the lessee affect the lease intensity of firms. To do so, we examine the impact of firms' location on the use of operating leases. The main idea of our paper is that, because obtaining information and monitoring is costly for potential lessors, especially when a lessee is relatively far away from financial centers, rural firms are less likely to use operating leases. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that rural firms tend to have lower lease intensities than similar urban and small city firms. In addition, we find that firms with higher levels of debt capacity lease less and firms that face more financial constraint lease more. Our findings are robust to industry and lease maturity controls and consistent with the existence of an agency problem associated with leasing.},

While, like Kim (1985), the author assumed that the quality of a car depends on the maintenance level, the maintenance level in this model is chosen when a car is still a ‘new’ car, i.e. after the warranty ends. The model implied that the average quality of traded used cars can be either higher or lower than the average quality of nontraded used cars. The study also found that leasing and CPO have substantially improved the information mechanism between buyers and sellers of used cars, which, in turn, has helped reduce adverse selection and improved the average quality of traded used cars in the market.},

We use the exemption at age 18 to estimate the impact of tort liability on accidents as well as on a wide variety of behaviors and safety investments by pilots and owners.

We use this model to derive testable implications and then conduct an empirical analysis to investigate whether the operation of the new- and used-car markets is consistent with the predictions of this theoretical approach. Our empirical results support the theoretical predictions of our model.

	abstract = {Abstract A number of recent papers have analyzed leasing in the new‐car market as a response to the adverse‐selection problem in the used‐car market originally explored in the seminal 1970 paper by George Akerlof. In this paper we consider a model characterized by both adverse selection, as in these earlier papers, and moral hazard concerning the maintenance choices of new‐car drivers. We show that this approach provides explanations for a number of empirical findings concerning real‐world new‐ and used‐car markets, including that leasing has become more popular over time, very high income new‐car drivers lease more, and used cars that were leased when new sell for more than used cars that were purchased when new. We also compare and contrast our approach to new‐car leasing with alternative approaches.},

	abstract = {The act of trading in a used car as partial payment for a new car resonates with practically all consumers. Such transactions are prevalent in many other durable goods markets, ranging from golf clubs to CT scanners. What roles do trade-ins play in these markets? What motivates the seller to set up a channel to facilitate trade-ins? Intuitively, accepting a trade-in would appear to stimulate demand for the producer's product, but facilitating the resale of these used goods that substitute for new goods might also increase cannibalization. Although such transactions involve billions of dollars, we know relatively little about this practice from the extant research literature. This paper develops an analytical model that incorporates key features of real-world durable goods markets: (i) coexistence of new and used goods markets, (ii) consumer heterogeneity with respect to quality sensitivity, (iii) firms that anticipate the cannibalization problem arising from the coexistence of new and used goods, and (iv) lemon problems in resale markets, whereby sellers of used goods are better informed than buyers about the quality of their particular item. In our analysis, a trade-in policy amounts to an intervention by the firm in the used goods market, which reduces inefficiencies arising from the lemon problem. It motivates owners to purchase new goods and reduces their proclivity to hold on to purchased goods because of the low price the latter would fetch in a lemon market. We also show that trade-in programs are more valuable for less reliable products, as well as for products that deteriorate more slowly. Our analysis shows that producers in durable goods markets should consider trade-in programs as a matter of routine. Despite cannibalization concerns arising from a more active resale market, a producer's profits will inevitably rise from introducing trade-ins, given pervasive lemon problems. We test the key predictions of the model about price and volume of trade by assembling a data set of transactions of U.S. automobile consumers and find broad support for our model.},

	abstract = {I construct a dynamic model of transactions in used capital to understand the role of leasing when trading is subject to frictions. Firms trade assets to adjust their productive capacity in response to shocks to profitability. Transaction costs hinder the efficiency of the allocation of capital, and lessors act as trading intermediaries who reduce trading frictions. The model predicts that leased assets trade more frequently and produce more output than owned assets, for two reasons. First, high-volatility firms are more likely to lease than low-volatility firms, since they expect to adjust their capacity more frequently. Second, ownership's larger transaction costs widen owners' inaction bands relative to lessees'.  Using data on commercial aircraft, I find that leased aircraft have holding durations 38-percent shorter and fly 6.5-percent more hours than owned aircraft. Additional tests indicate that most of these differential patterns in trading and utilization arise because owners have wider inaction bands than lessees, and carriers' self-selection into leasing plays a minor role.},

We argue that the benefit of leasing is that repossession of a leased asset is easier than foreclosure on the collateral of a secured loan, which implies that leasing has higher debt capacity than secured lending. However, leasing involves agency costs due to the separation of ownership and control. More financially constrained firms value the additional debt capacity more and hence lease more of their capital than less constrained firms. We provide empirical evidence consistent with this prediction. Our theory is consistent with the explanation of leasing by practitioners, namely that leasing “preserves capital,” which the academic literature considers a fallacy.},

Additionally, recent theoretical analyses suggest that leasing, by increasing the average quality of used goods offered for sale, may reduce adverse selection in durable goods markets. Indeed, I find an increase in the direct relationship between depreciation and trading volume for aircraft models with relatively high lease rates. Together these findings suggest that adverse selection is a prominent feature of the market for contemporary used business aircraft and that leasing mitigates the consequences of asymmetric information about the quality of used durable goods.},

As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

We study the diffusion of solar photovoltaic panels in California and find that at the average number of owner-occupied homes in a zip code, an additional installation increases the probability of an adoption in the zip code by 0.78 percentage points.

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.

I use a semi-parametric regression model to aid identification of cost factors by decomposing time-varying and cross-sectional components. I find that the use of Chinese manufactured panels are associated with costs that are 6\% lower. Economies of scale at the local level (number of yearly installations in a zip code) and at the installation level (size of the installation) are also associated with lower costs. Higher subsidies, and higher contractor market-share are associated with higher costs.

Two frequently used methods are pooling the data or using fixed effects (an extreme version of which estimates separate models for each site). The former approach ignores site effects. The latter incorporates site effects but lacks a framework for predicting the impact of subsequent implementations of the program (e.g., would a new implementation resemble Riverside?). I present a hierarchical model that lies between these two extremes. Using data from the Greater Avenues for Independence demonstration, I demonstrate that the model captures much of the site-to-site variation of the treatment effects but has less uncertainty than estimating the treatment effect separately for each site. I also show that when predictive uncertainty is ignored, the treatment impact for the Riverside sites is significant, but when predictive uncertainty is considered, the impact for these sites is insignificant. Finally, I demonstrate that the model extrapolates site effects with reasonable accuracy when the site being predicted does not differ substantially from the sites already observed. For example, the San Diego treatment effects could have been predicted based on their site characteristics, but the Riverside effects are consistently underpredicted.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore Bayesian inference in models with many instrumental variables that are potentially weakly correlated with the endogenous regressor. The prior distribution has a hierarchical (nested) structure. We apply the methods to the Angrist-Krueger (AK, 1991) analysis of returns to schooling using instrumental variables formed by interacting quarter of birth with state/year dummy variables. Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995) show that randomly generated instrumental variables, designed to match the AK data set, give two-stage least squares results that look similar to the results based on the actual instrumental variables. Using a hierarchical model with the AK data, we find a posterior distribution for the parameter of interest that is tight and plausible. Using data with randomly generated instruments, the posterior distribution is diffuse. Most of the information in the AK data can in fact be extracted with quarter of birth as the single instrumental variable. Using artificial data patterned on the AK data, we find that if all the information had been in the interactions between quarter of birth and state/year dummies, then the hierarchical model would still have led to precise inferences, whereas the single instrument model would have suggested that there was no information in the data. We conclude that hierarchical modeling is a conceptually straightforward way of efficiently combining many weak instrumental variables.},

Using earnings data from the 1980 census, we find that men who were educated in states with higher-quality schools have a higher return to additional years of schooling. Rates of return are also higher for individuals from states with better-educated teachers and with a higher fraction of female teachers. Holding constant school quality measures, however, we find no evidence that parental income or education affects average state-level rates of return.},

When identified Bayesian vector autoregression (VAR) models are presented with error bands in the existing literature, both conceptual and numerical problems have not been dealt with in an internally consistent way. In this paper we develop methods to introduce prior information in both reducedform and structural VAR models without introducing substantial new computational burdens. Our approach makes it feasible to use a single, large dynamic framework (for example, 20-variable models) for tasks of policy projections.},

The procedure is applied t o 10 macroeconomic variables and is shown to improve out-of-sample forecasts relative to univariate equations. Although cross-variable responses are damped by the prior, considerable interaction among the variables is shown to be captured by the estimates We provide unconditional forecasts as of 1982:12 and 1983:3. We also describe how a model such as this can be used to make conditional projections and to analyze policy alternatives. As an example, we analyze a Congressional Budget Office forecast made in 1982: 12 Although no automatic causal interpretations arise from models like ours, they provide a detailed characterization of the dynamic statistical interdependence of a set of economic variables, information that may help in evaluating causal hypotheses without containing any such hypotheses.},

In particular, MCMC can be used to estimate models that are difficult to tackle with standard tools such as OLS, Instrumental Variables regressions and Maximum Likelihood. Starting from simple examples, this chapter exploits the modularity of MCMC to build sophisticated discrete choice, self-selection, panel data and structural models that can be applied to a variety of topics. Emphasis is placed on cases for which estimation by MCMC has distinct benefits compared to the standard methods in the field. I conclude with a list of suggested applications.
