	abstract = {In recent years, the practitioner literature in operations management has seen a dramatic surge in articles on quality management. It reflects the increased emphasis on quality by U.S. firms, which has been attributed largely to increased competition faced by them. The question of how quality is influenced by competitive intensity, however, has not received much attention, either in the practitioner or the academic research literatures. The notion of competitive intensity itself has not been defined precisely. In this paper, we develop formal models of oligopolistic competition to investigate whether equilibrium levels of quality increase as competition intensifies. We consider three different competitive settings: (i) asymmetric duopolistic competition where the dominant firm's intrinsic demand potential decreases; (ii) a symmetric duopoly where the firms are precluded from cooperating in setting quality levels; and (iii) symmetric oligopolistic competition where the number of firms increases. We find that the relation between equilibrium quality and competitive intensity depends on what is understood by increased competition and, in addition, the relation is contingent on the values of parameters describing the cost and demand structure for the industry.},

	abstract = {Much of the research on quality practices and performance reflects a resource-based perspective of the firm, dealing primarily with internal issues of managerial and technological competence in developing and executing an effective TQM strategy. The neoclassical perspective on the influence of the competitive environment on quality practices and performance remains conspicuously absent in the empirical quality literature. Our study aims to address this gap by examining the contingent role of international competition on quality management and performance. We develop and test an integrative framework of quality management, consisting of high involvement work practices, quality practices, quality performance, and firm performance. We then examine the contingent effects of international competition on the constructs and relationships of the framework. International competition was found to moderate the relationship between quality practices and customer satisfaction performance, as well as the relationship between high involvement work practices and firm performance. The moderator effects suggest interesting implications for quality theory and practice.},

Due to volatility of orders from buyers, the supplier and the manufacturer in the supply chain are subject to financial risk. In contrast to the general assumption that players in a supply chain are risk neutral in quality investment and price decision, we consider the risk-averse behavior of the players in three different supply chain strategies: Vertical Integration (VI), Manufacturer’s Stackelberg (MS) and Supplier’s Stackelberg (SS). The study shows that both supply chain strategy and risk-averse behavior have significant impacts on quality investment and pricing. Compared to a risk-neutral supply chain, a risk-averse supply chain has lower, same and higher quality of products in VI, MS and SS, respectively. Also, we derive the conditions under which the supply chain strategy is implemented in a decentralized setting. A numerical study is used to illustrate some related issues.},

	abstract = {This paper integrates the process oriented view of quality in manufacturing with the multi-attribute product positioning and customer preference models of marketing, within the context of traditional economic models of markets and competition. In manufacturing applications, “quality” is often defined as conformance to specifications or as meeting standards on the performance of the product. In the marketing and economics literature, “quality” typically refers to the performance level or “class” of the product. To capture both perspectives, a product is described by a vector of performance attributes, and the population of produced units is assumed to display a distribution on these attributes. The distribution perceived by customers may differ from the actual. The attribute levels (means) may be taken to define the class, or performance of the product. Quality in the sense of conformance is then conceptually identified with the absence of variation of the population. Consumer preferences are modelled by a cardinal utility function defined on the vector of attributes and price, and customers maximize expected utility. Product manufacturers are assumed to face a cost of producing a given population distribution. Under specific assumptions regarding costs and utility functions, models of monopoly, oligopoly and perfect competition are formulated. The model clarifies the distinction between product class (performance) and conformance quality, identifies the sources of quality improvement, and provides an economic framework relating issues like product positioning, process improvement, quality function deployment (QFD) and customer preference estimation. This framework is used to address issues such as quality costs and benefits and the economics of investments in quality.},

A model is introduced here to guide a firm in addressing these questions. The firm produces a single product and operates in a market where monopolistic competition is effective. Demand for the product in the industry depends on both price and performance quality. Increasing productivity knowledge decreases unit production cost, but demand for the company’s product decreases over time, as competitors will be able to offer products with similar performance. Productivity and quality knowledge can be developed through induced and autonomous learning in order to strengthen company position. The paper provides an optimal control formulation of the problem and develops necessary conditions for optimality and characterizes the dynamics of optimal price, quality and investment decisions.},

We find that incumbent on-time performance (OTP) actually worsens in response to entry, and even entry threats, by Southwest Airlines. Since Southwest is both a top-performing airline in OTP and a low-cost carrier (LCC), we conjecture that this response by incumbents may be due to a cost-cutting strategy that allows for intense postentry price competition along with preentry deterrence, or it may be due to a postentry differentiation strategy along with preentry accommodation. Further analysis of entry and entry threats by other airlines is inconclusive, providing evidence that is partially consistent with both hypotheses. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of worsening OTP can only be observed when the (potential) entrant is a LCC (Southwest, Jet Blue, and AirTran).Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1918.This paper was accepted by by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy.},

Consumers purchase a product based on not only its price but also its quality level; therefore, two firms compete in determining their prices and quality levels to maximize their profits. The asymmetry arises from the difference in consumers’ loyalty to each firm; that asymmetry then determines a character of differentiation between firms. Our purpose is to show how asymmetry influences competition under varying consumers’ price- and quality-sensitivity. In doing so, we extend earlier work in the area of price and quality competition. We show that in both the moderately quality-sensitive and price-sensitive markets, higher consumers’ sensitivity as well as lower consumers’ loyalty to any firm leads to intense competition, resulting in a decrease of both firms’ equilibrium profits. On the other hand, in highly quality-sensitive market, asymmetry compels the smaller firm to change its competitive strategy. In general, this is more beneficial to the larger firm, as the smaller firm’s profit tends to decline. In the worst case, the smaller firm is driven out of business under equilibrium.},

We identify conditions under which the incumbent may actually over-invest in quality to deter entrance.

As commoditization is relevant to an ever-greater number of diverse industries, this research addresses two main questions: (1) How can managers assess their industry's level of commoditization to be better informed about their firm's competitive environment? and (2) How does the level of commoditization in an industry affect the effectiveness of marketing strategies? Initially, in-depth field interviews identified the characteristics of the commoditization phenomenon. Subsequently, a survey study among 141 companies from ten industries applied a measure to assess an industry's commoditization level. The results showed significant differences between high and low commodity markets in terms of the impact of three different strategic orientations on firm performance. The application of the value disciplines framework revealed that as commoditization increases, operational excellence and product leadership lose impact, while customer intimacy becomes a more vital performance driver. The results indicate that commoditization assessment may become a vital part of a firm's strategic efforts to address evolving marketing competition.},

Pricing at multiples above unit cost requires something special - valued brand, frontier features, unique service, or lightening-fast distribution. In the beginning, computers were not commodities. During its heyday, IBM had the most storied distribution and servicing network in the world. IBM's engineering was pretty good, too. The combination of advanced technology and tailored service was extremely potent. IBM dominated the market. It was able to charge prices at multiple levels above a machine's unit cost. Computing has come a long way since then. Today, very few firms can garner high margins on their products. This fact fosters a myth that all high-tech product markets eventually evolve into commodities. There are four positive and three negative strategies firms use to fight commodification. It is simply wrong to argue that firms cannot make money in a commodity technology market.

This is becoming increasingly challenging, since hourly price densities for electricity exhibit a variety of shapes, with their characteristic features changing substantially within the day and evolving over time. Furthermore, the influx of renewable power, wind, and solar, in particular, has made these density shapes very weather dependent. We develop a general four-parameter stochastic model for hourly prices, in which the four moments of the density function are dynamically estimated as latent state variables and, furthermore, modelled as functions of several plausible exogenous drivers. This provides a transparent and credible model that is sufficiently flexible to capture the shape-shifting effects, particularly with respect to the wind and solar output variations causing dynamic switches in the upside and downside risks. Extensive testing on German wholesale price data, benchmarked against quantile regression and other models in out-of-sample backtesting, validated the approach and its analytical appeal.The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2018.1733.},

Photovoltaic energy has presented a major evolution and it is forecasted as being an important contributor to power generation and an alternative to other non-renewable energy sources. The high cost of solar electricity is today the main reason why electricity from photovoltaic systems has not been introduced in a more widespread way. In this context, the aim of this paper is the study and analysis of the decision criteria to be used when searching for the best photovoltaic cell, studying both the criteria that exert most influence or their manufacture (defined by quantitative and qualitative values) and the alternatives which will be the decision problem to be solved; each alternative will correspond to one type of photovoltaic cell.

The main of objective of this study is to provide a review on the application and use of decision making approaches in regard to energy management problems. This paper selected and reviewed 196 published papers, from 1995 to 2015 in 72 important journals related to energy management, which chosen from the “Web of Science” database and in this regard, the systematic and meta-analysis method which called “PRISMA” has been proposed. All published papers were categorized into 13 different fields: environmental impact assessment, waste management, sustainability assessment, renewable energy, energy sustainability, land management, green management topics, water resources management, climate change, strategic environmental assessment, construction and environmental management and other energy management areas. Furthermore, papers were categorized based on the authors, publication year, nationality of authors, region, technique and application, number of criteria, research purpose, gap and contribution, solution and modeling, results and findings. Hybrid MCDM and fuzzy MCDM in the integrated methods were ranked as the first methods in use. The Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review was the important journal in this paper, with 32 published papers. Finally, environmental impact assessment was ranked as the first area that applied decision making approaches. Results of this study acknowledge that decision making approaches can help decision makers and stakeholders in solving some problems under uncertainties situations in environmental decision making and these approaches have seen increasing interest among previous researchers to use these approaches in various steps of environmental decision making process.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a compromise programming (CP) model to help investors decide whether to construct photovoltaic power plants with government financial support. For this purpose, we simulate an agreement between the government, who pursues political prices (guaranteed prices) as low as possible, and the project sponsor who wants returns (stochastic cash flows) as high as possible. The sponsor’s decision depends on the positive or negative result of this simulation, the resulting simulated price being compared to the effective guaranteed price established by the country legislation for photovoltaic energy. To undertake the simulation, the CP model articulates variables such as ranges of guaranteed prices, technical characteristics of the plant, expected energy to be generated over the investment life, investment cost, cash flow probabilities, and others. To determine the CP metric, risk aversion is assumed. As an actual application, a case study on photovoltaic power investment in Extremadura, western Spain, is developed in detail.},

In order to more accurately predict the output power of the photovoltaic power generation system and reduce the impact of photovoltaic power generation on the power system, this study proposes a prediction model based on an improved firefly algorithm optimized support vector machine. The model introduces the linear decreasing inertia weight and the adaptive variable step-size in the original firefly algorithm that effectively improves the convergence speed and optimization ability of the algorithm. The multiple meteorological factors influencing the photovoltaic power generation were studied. Calculate the correlation coefficient of each meteorological influencing factor between the forecasted date and historical date to determine the training sample. The training samples were used to train the prediction model. The photovoltaic array output power in the sunny, cloudy and rainy days was predicted for the three weather styles using the trained prediction model. The results were compared the prediction results on the standard firefly algorithm-based optimizing support vector machine and particle swarm algorithm-based optimizing support vector machines. The proposed method showed that the mean absolute percentage error of the three-weather style prediction result is reduced by 1.66 and 3.30\% and the mean square error is reduced by 0.21 and 0.27 compared to other methods. This method is verified to predict the PV array output power more accurately.},

The procedure has also been used in other government procurements and appears to be applicable in a variety of project funding processes. The technical quality of each proposed applications experiment was summarized through the use of multiple evaluation measures, or attributes. These were combined into a single index of the overall technical quality of an experiment through the use of a multiattribute utility function. Recently derived results in measurable value theory were applied to derive an index of the overall technical quality of a portfolio of experiments. Budgetary and programmatic issues were handled through the use of constraints. This approach allowed the portfolio selection problem to be formulated as an integer linear program. Details of the application are presented, including a discussion of the data requirements and assessment procedure used. The portfolio selection procedure was successfully applied, and variations of it have been successfully used in four other solar energy procurements.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the capacity investment decision of a supplier who solicits private forecast information from a manufacturer. To ensure abundant supply, the manufacturer has an incentive to inflate her forecast in a costless, nonbinding, and nonverifiable type of communication known as “cheap talk.” According to standard game theory, parties do not cooperate and the only equilibrium is uninformative—the manufacturer's report is independent of her forecast and the supplier does not use the report to determine capacity. However, we observe in controlled laboratory experiments that parties cooperate even in the absence of reputation-building mechanisms and complex contracts. We argue that the underlying reason for cooperation is trust and trustworthiness. The extant literature on forecast sharing and supply chain coordination implicitly assumes that supply chain members either absolutely trust each other and cooperate when sharing forecast information, or do not trust each other at all. Contrary to this all-or-nothing view, we determine that a continuum exists between these two extremes. In addition, we determine (i) when trust is important in forecast information sharing, (ii) how trust is affected by changes in the supply chain environment, and (iii) how trust affects related operational decisions. To explain and better understand the observed behavioral regularities, we also develop an analytical model of trust to incorporate both pecuniary and nonpecuniary incentives in the game-theoretic analysis of cheap-talk forecast communication. The model identifies and quantifies how trust and trustworthiness induce effective cheap-talk forecast sharing under the wholesale price contract. We also determine the impact of repeated interactions and information feedback on trust and cooperation in forecast sharing. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our results for developing effective forecast management policies.This paper was accepted by Ananth Iyer, operations and supply chain management.},

	abstract = {The risk of supply disruption increases as firms seek to procure from cheaper, but unproven, suppliers. We model a supply chain consisting of a single buyer and two suppliers, both of which compete for the buyer's order and face risk of supply disruption. One supplier is comparatively more reliable but also more expensive, whereas the other one is less reliable but cheaper and faces higher risk of disruption. Moreover, the risk level of the unreliable supplier may be private information, and this lack of visibility increases the buyer's purchasing risk. In such settings, the unreliable supplier often provides a price and quantity (P\&Q) guarantee to the buyer. Our objective is to study the underlying motivation for the guarantee offer and its effects on the competitive intensity and the performance of the chain partners. Our model also includes a spot market that can be utilized by any party to buy or to sell. The spot market price is random, partially depends on the available capacity of the two suppliers, and has a positive spread between buying and selling prices. We analytically characterize the equilibrium contracts for the two suppliers and the buyer's optimal procurement strategy. First, our analysis shows that P\&Q guarantee allows the unreliable supplier to better compete against the more reliable one by providing supply assurance to the buyer. More importantly, when information asymmetry risk is high, use of a guarantee may enable the unreliable supplier to credibly signal her true risk, thereby improving visibility into the chain. This signal can also be used by the buyer to infer the expected spot market price. In spite of these benefits, a guarantee offer in an asymmetric setting may not always be desirable for the buyer. Rather, it can reduce competition between the suppliers, resulting in higher costs for the buyer.This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management.},

We use the bilateral monopoly setting to analyze six scenarios: three increasingly general contracts (wholesale-pricing schemes, two-part linear schemes, and twopart nonlinear schemes), each under full and incomplete information about the buyer's cost structure. We allow both sides to refuse to trade by explicitly including reservation profit levels for both; for the supplier, this is implemented through a cutoff policy. We derive the supplier's optimal contracts and profits for all six scenarios and examine the value of information and of more general contracts. Our key findings are as follows: First, the value of information is higher under two-part contracts; second, the value of offering two-part contracts is higher under full information; and third, the proportion of buyers the supplier will choose to exclude can be substantial.},

Changing facilities from net energy users to net energy producers is a major concern for supply chain managers who are interested in greening their business. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is an innovative design idea to achieve energy positive buildings. In a BIPV building, photovoltaic (PV) arrays are integrated into the structure of the building in order to transform the incident solar radiation to clean energy that can be used in facility operations. This option is dependent on the economic attractiveness of the solar PVs, which, in return, depends on the policies (incentives, subsidies, feed-in tariff) in effect at the facility location, the efficiency of the PVs installed, and the amount of incident solar radiation at the facility location. We present an economic model that calculates the cost per kWh capacity of solar PVs installed and then integrate the decision of installing PVs of different sizes on the facility rooftops of a supply chain subject to the different environmental policies available. We study the implications of our model based on a sensitivity analysis for different carbon credit prices, PV generation costs, and feed-in tariff prices.},

	abstract = {Although the supply chain (SC) management literature has extensively analyzed how features of SC relationships affect quality performance, it barely considers the role played by SC governance in managing and promoting quality performance. This study examines how quality performance is affected by two SC governance decisions in agri-food chains: (i) the adoption of a geographical indication (GI), and (ii) the creation of co-operative (co-op) ownership structures. Focusing on the wine industry, the study first examines how GIs encourage quality by improving vertical adaptation and leveraging resources (e.g., knowledge) of all SC members. Second, it analyzes how co-ops' collective action and horizon investment problems may hinder the delivery of high-quality products. The paper also examines how the effectiveness of GIs in promoting quality is contingent on the ownership structure of agri-food chains. Data from 327 wine producers and quality scores for 1951 bottled wines are used to test the hypotheses. The results reveal that on average, the quality of wineries is positively associated with the adoption of the most stringent GIs. Second, although co-ops are negatively correlated with final quality compared to investor-owned firms (IOFs), this disadvantage is moderated when co-ops are certified under the most stringent GIs. However, these GIs are not related to wine quality within IOFs, suggesting that quality certifications are more effective when used within suitable governance structures.},

Product recalls are serious quality failures in supply chains with significant, negative impacts on firm performance. Product recalls are frequently connected to the globalization of supply chains. Globalization has, at times, promoted inconsistency in quality control and standards, leading to quality problems and failures. Data across multiple industries, with widely reported recalls, have been collected and analyzed using regression techniques. Our findings indicate that offshore outsourcing has a greater impact on recalls than offshoring without outsourcing; outsourcing domestically has the least influence. Outsourcing to a smaller supplier base may lead to fewer recalls at low levels of outsourcing. However, it may exacerbate the impact of outsourcing on recalls at high levels of outsourcing.},

Producers at the supply markets are aware of the quality of their products, whereas consumers, located at the demand markets, are aware only of the average quality of the products that are shipped to their demand markets. Minimum quality standards are also captured in order to assess the impacts of such policy interventions. We establish qualitative results, in the form of existence, uniqueness, and stability analysis. An algorithm is proposed, along with a convergence proof. It is then utilized to compute solutions to a spectrum of spatial price equilibrium numerical examples in order to explore the impacts of information asymmetry under different scenarios. The numerical examples, which are of quite general functional forms, reveal that, as the number of supply markets increases, the “anonymizing” effect leads to a decrease in the average quality. On the other hand, as the number of demand markets increases, the pressure to improve quality increases, and the average quality increases. Finally, we demonstrate that, after the imposition of minimum quality standards, the average quality at the demand markets increases and the prices also increase.},

Optimization of any one of the objectives is a linear programming problem. Utility functions over the objectives were assessed with several individuals.

Decision-making concerning the most appropriate energy technology for supplying these areas has been difficult; existing energy decision-support tools have been useful but are mostly incomplete. Trade-offs, as well as impacts that can be positive or negative, may emerge as a result of implementing modern forms of energy. These can affect both community’s livelihoods as well as the confidence of decision-makers in relation to alternative technologies. The paper discusses a newly designed multicriteria approach and its novel robustness analysis for selecting energy generation systems for the improvement of livelihoods in rural areas. The proposed methodology builds upon a sustainable rural livelihoods framework to address multiple interactions and calculate trade-offs aimed at boosting decision-makers’ confidence in the selected technologies.

Lately, it is widely recognized that regional energy planning forms a multi-actor and multicriteria problem. This is particularly true in the case of power generation in regions presenting high rates of increase in electricity demand, together with a significant potential of renewable energy sources, since several and often conflicting points of view must be taken into account. In this paper, the contribution of a Multicriteria Decision Aid method — namely ELECTRE III — addressing in such problems is investigated through the examination of a particular case study in a Greek island. Through the presentation of the procedure followed (identification of actors, selection of criteria, formulation of alternative strategies, application of the specific method and analysis of results and actors' reactions), an effort is made to highlight those aspects that are crucial in reaching a compromise in regional energy planning problems.},

The production, transportation, storage and consumption of all these goods, however, have created large environmental problems. Today, global warming, created by large scale emissions of greenhouse gasses, is a top environmental concern. Governments, action groups and companies are asking for measures to counter this threat. Operations Research has a long tradition in improving operations and especially in reducing costs. In this paper, we present a review that highlights the contribution of Operations Research to green logistics, which involves the integration of environmental aspects in logistics. We give a sketch of the present and possible developments, focussing on design, planning and control in a supply chain for transportation, inventory of products and facility decisions. While doing this, we also indicate several areas where environmental aspects could be included in OR models for logistics.},

We propose a novel modelling approach to support supply chain managers decide the optimal level of investment to improve quality performance under uncertainty. We develop a Poisson–Gamma model within a Bayesian framework, representing both the epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in non-conformance rates. Estimates are obtained to value a supplier quality improvement activity and assess if it is worth gaining more information to reduce epistemic uncertainty. The theoretical properties of our model provide new insights about the relationship between the degree of epistemic uncertainty, the effectiveness of development programmes, and the levels of investment. We find that the optimal level of investment does not have a monotonic relationship with the rate of effectiveness. If investment is deferred until epistemic uncertainty is removed then the expected optimal investment monotonically decreases as prior variance increases but only if the prior mean is above a critical threshold. We develop methods to facilitate practical application of the model to industrial decisions by a) enabling use of the model with typical data available to major companies and b) developing computationally efficient approximations that can be implemented easily. Application to a real industry context illustrates the use of the model to support practical planning decisions to learn more about supplier quality and to invest in improving supplier capability.},

Aiming at a comprehensive and consistent reliability assessment, we first investigate the system as a whole, and then derive a general solution for an individual supplier’s contribution. Implicitly, we identify changing returns to scale, gains of diversification, and non-additivity. As these properties are often undesirable, e.g., for the purpose of accounting or in specific auction formats, we build on concepts from cooperative game theory to provide the Shapley value as the unique consistent reliability allocation rule. We then illustrate practical relevance and applicability of our approach for the case of wind power contributing to the reliability of Germany’s electricity system, and discuss how today’s reliability mechanisms may be improved by considering interdependencies between suppliers.},

The intent of this paper is to examine the difficulties that arise when trying to pursue a parallel strategy in the presence of multiple objectives. The basic elements of the problem include a set of projects, a set of objectives, the associated probability measures relating effort to success, budgetary and performance constraints, and a utility function defined on the range of outcomes. In the model it will be assumed that each project contributes to one or more objectives, and that the selection criterion is based on expected utility maximization. With this in mind, the problem is formulated as a probabilistic goal programme and solved with a heuristic that computes the K best funding schemes. Results are presented for a case involving the development of a non-petroleum-powered vehicle which demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm and the implications of the underlying decision rules.},

We suggest that government decision-makers set a policy goal for the cumulated installed total quantity of grid-connected PV systems for a certain planning horizon. The objective of their mathematical programming is to minimize the system total average cost of feed-in tariffs (FITs) policy support and the learning investment per kilowatt (kW) PV system installed. In order to attain this goal, they must determine the appropriate FIT unit price and constant change rate that will stimulate residents of developing countries to install the PV systems rapidly. We also expect to achieve a learning effect through the accumulating experience in grid-connected PV systems that will reduce the system installed cost per kW each year. Our analysis reveals that the unit PV installed cost decreases with time and that the cost reduction is quite rapid when the change rate is large. To a certain extent, levering the magnitude of the change rate could affect the growth of the PV product life cycle. If governments in developing countries need to install a large quantity of PV systems at an early stage to reverse global warming or overcome the effects of climate change, then they must choose a higher change rate with a relatively larger initial FIT unit price to a FIT scheme.},

A fundamental issue in these applications is how to synthesize the judgments of individual experts into a group judgment. In this paper we propose an approach to synthesis based on Bayesian hierarchical models, and apply it to the problem of determining physician staffing at medical centers operated by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA).Our starting point is the supra-Bayesian approach to synthesis, whose principal motivation in the present context is to generate an estimate of the uncertainty associated with a panel's evaluation of the number of physicians required under specified conditions. Hierarchical models are particularly natural in this context since variability in the experts' judgments results in part from heterogeneity in their baseline experiences at different VA medical centers.We derive alternative hierarchical Bayes synthesis distributions for the number of physicians required to handle the (service-mix specific) daily workload in internal medicine at a given VA medical center (VAMC). The analysis appears to be the first to provide a statistical treatment of expert judgment processes for evaluating the appropriate use of resources in health care. Also, while hierarchical models are well established, their application to the synthesis of expert judgment is novel.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider an electricity market that consists of a day-ahead and a balancing settlement, and includes a number of stochastic producers. We first introduce two reference procedures for scheduling and pricing energy in the day-ahead market: on the one hand, a conventional network-constrained auction purely based on the least-cost merit order, where stochastic generation enters with its expected production and a low marginal cost; on the other, a counterfactual auction that also accounts for the projected balancing costs using stochastic programming. Although the stochastic clearing procedure attains higher market efficiency in expectation than the conventional day-ahead auction, it suffers from fundamental drawbacks with a view to its practical implementation. In particular, it requires flexible producers (those that make up for the lack or surplus of stochastic generation) to accept losses in some scenarios. Using a bilevel programming framework, we then show that the conventional auction, if combined with a suitable day-ahead dispatch of stochastic producers (generally different from their expected production), can substantially increase market efficiency and emulate the advantageous features of the stochastic optimization ideal, while avoiding its major pitfalls. A two-node power system serves as both an illustrative example and a proof of concept. Finally, a more realistic case study highlights the main advantages of a smart day-ahead dispatch of stochastic producers.},

New information becomes available as time progresses. The manufacturer updates his belief on demand and/or spot price and subsequently decides the contract quantity. The demand and spot price are correlated. Thus, the new demand information also updates the belief on the spot price, and vice versa. We model the problem with an information updating Stackelberg game and derive unique equilibrium strategies. Previous studies have considered only the demand information and concluded that improved demand information always benefits the supplier. By contrast, we demonstrate that improved demand information benefits both the supplier and manufacturer if the correlation coefficient between the two uncertainties has a small positive value and benefits the manufacturer but hurts the supplier otherwise. Moreover, superior spot price information benefits only the manufacturer and always hurts the supplier. Surprisingly, superior information fails to improve the performance of the supply chain and only changes the allocation of the profits between the supplier and manufacturer. Our findings likewise provide insights into when the supplier intends to use the contract channel and which type of information updating facility or expertise to invest in if a choice must be made.},

The retailer then sells the final products to the market at a stochastic clearance price. We investigate a flexible price contract that allows the manufacturer to determine the product wholesale price, and the retailer to determine the order quantity, based on the future spot price of consumption commodities. Compared with the simple wholesale price contract, a win–win situation can be achieved under the flexible price contract when the manufacturer's postponed processing cost is lower than a threshold. However, under this flexible price contract the retailer may suffer from the commodity price volatility, even if she does not procure the commodities directly. We further investigate how the risk-averse retailer conducts mean–variance financial hedging by purchasing consumption commodity futures contracts. We formulate the problem using a dynamic programming model and derive a closed-form time-consistent financial hedging policy. Through numerical experiments, we show that the commodity price risk from the manufacturer to the retailer is effectively mitigated with the hedging, and the benefits of the flexible price contract are maintained.},

We develop a game theoretic model to investigate how these insights are affected when the vendor is privately informed about the reliability of a newly developed product. A novel feature of our model is the interaction between reliability signaling (private information) and the vendor’s discretionary investment in spares inventory (private action), which arises naturally in the setting we consider. We find that this interaction leads to contrasting equilibrium outcomes under the two contracts: RBC induces the vendor to focus on inventory savings, leading to underinvestment in spares, whereas PBC induces the vendor to focus on reliability signaling, achieved through overinvestment in inventory. As a result, neither contract is efficient. We investigate two means to mitigate this inefficiency, but either approach has caveats: (a) making inventory verifiable removes the trade-off between reliability signaling and inventory investment, but results in diverging contract preferences between the vendor and the buyer; (b) pooling inventories across multiple buyers saves inventory costs but it also hinders reliability signaling, potentially exacerbating inefficiency.This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.},

The original firms compete with one another in terms of in-house quality levels and product flows, whereas the contractors, aiming at maximizing their own profits, engage in competition for the outsourced production and distribution in terms of prices that they charge and their quality levels. The solution of the model provides each original firm with its optimal in-house quality level as well as its optimal in-house and outsourced production and shipment quantities that minimize the total cost and the weighted cost of disrepute, associated with lower quality levels and the impact on a firm’s reputation. The governing equilibrium conditions of the model are formulated as a variational inequality problem. An algorithm, which provides a discrete-time adjustment process and tracks the evolution of the product flows, quality levels, and prices over time, is proposed and convergence results given. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate how such a supply chain network game theory model can be applied in practice.

	abstract = {In this paper, we formulate in a game-theoretic framework three coordination schemes for analyzing DSO-TSO interactions. This framework relies on a reformulation of the power flow equations by introducing linear mappings between the state and the decision variables. The first coordination scheme, used as a benchmark, is a co-optimization problem where an integrated market operator activates jointly resources connected at transmission and distribution levels. We formulate it as a standard constrained optimization problem. The second one, called shared balancing responsibility, assumes bounded rationality of TSO and DSOs which act simultaneously and is formulated as a non-cooperative game. The last one involves rational expectation from the DSOs which anticipate the clearing of the transmission market by the TSO, and is formulated as a Stackelberg game. For each coordination scheme, we determine conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions. On a network instance from the NICTA NESTA test cases, we span the set of Generalized Nash Equilibria solutions of the decentralized coordination schemes. We determine that the decentralized coordination schemes are more profitable for the TSO and that rational expectations from the DSOs gives rise to a last-mover advantage for the TSO. Highest efficiency level is reached by the centralized co-optimization, followed very closely by the shared balancing responsibility. The mean social welfare is higher for the Stackelberg game than under shared balancing responsibility. Finally, under imperfect information, we check that the Price of Information, measured as the worst-case ratio of the optimal achievable social welfare with full information to the social welfare at an equilibrium with imperfect information, is a stepwise increasing function of the coefficient of variation of the TSO and reaches an upper bound.},

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes – the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size ε and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter ε on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

	abstract = {Conjoint analysis has played an important role in helping make a number of operations management decisions including product and service design, supplier selection, and service operations capacity. Many recent advances in this area have raised questions about the most appropriate form of conjoint analysis for this research. We review recent developments in the literature and provide new evidence on how the choice between ratings- and choice-based conjoint models might affect the estimates of customer demand used in operations management models. The biggest systematic difference between ratings-based (RB) and choice-based (CB) parameters is consistent with the compatibility effect, i.e., some enriched attributes like brand name tend to be more important in RB models and some comparable attributes like price are likely to be more important in CB models. Still, there were reasonably small differences between choice- and ratings-based parameters. Parameter similarity was also seen in the lack of differences both in the choice share validations when the “keep on shopping” alternative was not considered and in the profiles that were predicted to maximize choice shares. This suggests that the two approaches will produce similar estimates of the relative importance of various attributes. In spite of demonstrated success with each method, several reasons lead us to recommend the use of hierarchical Bayesian choice-based conjoint models. First, the slightly higher individual hit rate validations give us greater confidence in predictive accuracy overall as well as an increased ability to target individual customers. Additionally, the greater ease of modeling both changes in market size and competitive reactions are attractive benefits of choice-based models.},

	abstract = {The increasing consideration of behavioral aspects in operations management models has prompted greater use of choice-based conjoint (CBC) studies in operations research. Such studies can elicit consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP), a core input for many optimization models. However, optimization models can yield valid results only if consumers’ WTP is estimated accurately. A simulation study and two field studies show that extreme response behavior in CBC studies, such that consumers always or never choose the no-purchase option, harms the validity of WTP estimates. Reporting the share of consumers who always and never select the no-purchase option allows for detecting extreme response behavior. This study suggests an individually adapted design that avoids extreme response behavior and thus significantly improves WTP estimation accuracy.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges managers face when trying to understand complex, technological systems (in their efforts to mitigate system risks) is the quantification of accident probability, particularly in the case of rare events. Once this risk information has been quantified, managers and decision makers can use it to develop appropriate policies, design projects, and/or allocate resources that will mitigate risk. However, rare event risk information inherently suffers from a sparseness of accident data. Therefore, expert judgment is often elicited to develop frequency data for these high-consequence rare events. When applied appropriately, expert judgment can serve as an important (and, at times, the only) source of risk information. This paper presents a Bayesian methodology for assessing relative accident probabilities and their uncertainty using paired comparison to elicit expert judgments. The approach is illustrated using expert judgment data elicited for a risk study of the largest passenger ferry system in the US.},

Survival analysis has been introduced with its ability to deal with censored data. The mixture cure model, one important branch of survival models, is also applied in the context of credit scoring, assuming that the study population is a mixture of never-default and will-default customers. We extend the standard mixture cure model through: (1) relaxing the independence assumption of the probability and the time of default; (2) treating the missing defaulting labels as latent variables and applying an augmentation technique; and (3) introducing a discrete truncated exponential distribution to model the time of default. Our full model is written in a hierarchical form so that the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is applied to estimate corresponding parameters. Through an empirical analysis, we show that both mixture models, the standard mixture cure model and the hierarchical mixture cure model (HMCM), are more advanced in identifying future defaulters while compared with logistic regression. It is also concluded that our hierarchical Bayesian extension increases the model’s predictability and provides meaningful output for risk management.},

The proposed procedure naturally extends to the analysis of incomplete and/or imprecise pairwise comparison matrices, enhancing realism, practicality and scope.

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the spatial representation of market structure calibrated on actual or intended choice data. Previous models developed for that purpose accommodate consumer heterogeneity by estimating parameters for each consumer, typically using the method of maximum likelihood. This approach to heterogeneity avoids assuming any particular distribution of the individual level parameters across the sample, but leads to problems related to the consistency of the estimates, sufficient degrees of freedom, and the validity of asymptotic standard errors and test statistics. Of greater concern is the assumption of independence of the choice observations within the same individual. This assumption is necessary in a maximum likelihood (MLE) framework to make the estimation computationally feasible. However, the marketing and psychology literature (cf. Manrai, 1995; Tversky and Simonson, 1993; Kim et al., forth coming) demonstrates that dependencies among choice alternatives may exist, and negligence to take such covariance into account may lead to inconsistent estimates, reduced predictive validity, and incorrect managerial action. We develop a new multidimensional scaling (MDS) model that estimates spatial market structures from pick-any/J choice data, provides for individual level parameters, and allows for correlations among the choice alternatives across individuals. We provide a Bayesian estimation method that overcomes the traditional problems associated with estimating models with such correlated alternatives. We provide an application to pick-any/J data for various brands of portable telephones. In a comparative analysis, we show that the proposed model outperforms one in which the utilities are assumed to be uncorrelated across choice alternatives.},

We consider both multiple sources of uncertainty under each support scheme and uncertainty with respect to any change of support scheme, and we obtain both analytical (when possible) and numerical solutions. In a Nordic case study based on wind power, we find that the feed-in tariff encourages earlier investment. Nevertheless, as investment has been undertaken, renewable energy certificate trading creates incentives for larger projects. In our baseline scenario and taking the fixed feed-in tariff as a base, the revenue required to trigger investments is 61\% higher with renewable certificates. At the same time, investment capacity is 61\% higher.},

We investigate whether agency costs between the lessor and the lessee affect the lease intensity of firms. To do so, we examine the impact of firms' location on the use of operating leases. The main idea of our paper is that, because obtaining information and monitoring is costly for potential lessors, especially when a lessee is relatively far away from financial centers, rural firms are less likely to use operating leases. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that rural firms tend to have lower lease intensities than similar urban and small city firms. In addition, we find that firms with higher levels of debt capacity lease less and firms that face more financial constraint lease more. Our findings are robust to industry and lease maturity controls and consistent with the existence of an agency problem associated with leasing.},

While, like Kim (1985), the author assumed that the quality of a car depends on the maintenance level, the maintenance level in this model is chosen when a car is still a ‘new’ car, i.e. after the warranty ends. The model implied that the average quality of traded used cars can be either higher or lower than the average quality of nontraded used cars. The study also found that leasing and CPO have substantially improved the information mechanism between buyers and sellers of used cars, which, in turn, has helped reduce adverse selection and improved the average quality of traded used cars in the market.},

	abstract = {The act of trading in a used car as partial payment for a new car resonates with practically all consumers. Such transactions are prevalent in many other durable goods markets, ranging from golf clubs to CT scanners. What roles do trade-ins play in these markets? What motivates the seller to set up a channel to facilitate trade-ins? Intuitively, accepting a trade-in would appear to stimulate demand for the producer's product, but facilitating the resale of these used goods that substitute for new goods might also increase cannibalization. Although such transactions involve billions of dollars, we know relatively little about this practice from the extant research literature. This paper develops an analytical model that incorporates key features of real-world durable goods markets: (i) coexistence of new and used goods markets, (ii) consumer heterogeneity with respect to quality sensitivity, (iii) firms that anticipate the cannibalization problem arising from the coexistence of new and used goods, and (iv) lemon problems in resale markets, whereby sellers of used goods are better informed than buyers about the quality of their particular item. In our analysis, a trade-in policy amounts to an intervention by the firm in the used goods market, which reduces inefficiencies arising from the lemon problem. It motivates owners to purchase new goods and reduces their proclivity to hold on to purchased goods because of the low price the latter would fetch in a lemon market. We also show that trade-in programs are more valuable for less reliable products, as well as for products that deteriorate more slowly. Our analysis shows that producers in durable goods markets should consider trade-in programs as a matter of routine. Despite cannibalization concerns arising from a more active resale market, a producer's profits will inevitably rise from introducing trade-ins, given pervasive lemon problems. We test the key predictions of the model about price and volume of trade by assembling a data set of transactions of U.S. automobile consumers and find broad support for our model.},

Firms trade assets to adjust their productive capacity in response to shocks to profitability. Transaction costs hinder the efficiency of the allocation of capital, and lessors act as trading intermediaries who reduce trading frictions. The model predicts that leased assets trade more frequently and produce more output than owned assets, for two reasons. First, high-volatility firms are more likely to lease than low-volatility firms, since they expect to adjust their capacity more frequently. Second, ownership's larger transaction costs widen owners' inaction bands relative to lessees'.  Using data on commercial aircraft, I find that leased aircraft have holding durations 38-percent shorter and fly 6.5-percent more hours than owned aircraft. Additional tests indicate that most of these differential patterns in trading and utilization arise because owners have wider inaction bands than lessees, and carriers' self-selection into leasing plays a minor role.},

We argue that the benefit of leasing is that repossession of a leased asset is easier than foreclosure on the collateral of a secured loan, which implies that leasing has higher debt capacity than secured lending.

More financially constrained firms value the additional debt capacity more and hence lease more of their capital than less constrained firms. We provide empirical evidence consistent with this prediction. Our theory is consistent with the explanation of leasing by practitioners, namely that leasing “preserves capital,” which the academic literature considers a fallacy.},

Indeed, I find an increase in the direct relationship between depreciation and trading volume for aircraft models with relatively high lease rates.

	abstract = {Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models is a comprehensive manual for the applied researcher who wants to perform data analysis using linear and nonlinear regression and multilevel models. The book introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the reader in how to fit these models using available software packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors' own applied research, with programming codes provided for each one. Topics covered include causal inference, including regression, poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided throughout. Author resource page: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/{\textasciitilde}gelman/arm/},

We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-ttt family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-ttt family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.},

	abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

It is shown in general that reputations, because they can reward high quality production only with a lag, can work only imperfectly. Viewing reputation as an expectation of quality, this article studies the properties of quality expectations that are fulfilled. When sellers set quality once and for all, any self-fulfilling quality level must lie below the perfect information quality level. The same is true of steady-state quality levels when sellers can vary quality over time. Finally, the relationship between consumer information and product quality is explored.},

A number of empirical studies document associations between risk premiums and proxies for asymmetric information such as earnings quality. However, the theoretical foundation for these studies has yet to be fully established. In this study, we consider the effects of private signals that are informative of both systematic factors and idiosyncratic shocks affecting asset payoffs in a competitive, noisy, rational expectations setting. Taking a large economy limit, we show that (1) risk premiums equal products of betas and factor risk premiums, irrespective of information asymmetries; (2) holding total information constant, greater information asymmetry leads to higher factor risk premiums and, thus, higher costs of capital; and (3) controlling for betas, there is no crosssectional effect of information asymmetries on cost of capital. These results provide guidance in interpreting the findings of existing empirical work and suggest specifications helpful for future research.},

But what evidence supports this assessment? Why must governments assure bank solvency, but not the solvency of other firms? Government oversight naturally displaces private efforts to evaluate and control financial firms. Moreover, if the banking business changes over time-as it assuredly has in the past decade or two-the best combination of government and private supervision may change concurrently. This paper reviews and evaluates the growing empirical literature on private investors' abilities to assess the financial condition of banking firms.

Using both hedonics and a repeat sales index approach we find that solar panels are capitalized at roughly a 3.5\% premium.

We provide a methodology for the simple, straightforward identification of peer effects with sufficiently rich data, avoiding the biases that occur with traditional fixed effects estimation when using the past installed base of consumers in the reference group. We study the diffusion of solar photovoltaic panels in California and find that at the average number of owner-occupied homes in a zip code, an additional installation increases the probability of an adoption in the zip code by 0.78 percentage points. Our results provide valuable guidance to marketers designing strategies to increase referrals and reduce customer acquisition costs.

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.  By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.

I use a semi-parametric regression model to aid identification of cost factors by decomposing time-varying and cross-sectional components. I find that the use of Chinese manufactured panels are associated with costs that are 6\% lower. Economies of scale at the local level (number of yearly installations in a zip code) and at the installation level (size of the installation) are also associated with lower costs. Higher subsidies, and higher contractor market-share are associated with higher costs. I use an exploratory analysis of the dominant contractor, SolarCity, to discuss non-cost factors in the expansion of the solar photovoltaic market.},

Two frequently used methods are pooling the data or using fixed effects (an extreme version of which estimates separate models for each site). The former approach ignores site effects. The latter incorporates site effects but lacks a framework for predicting the impact of subsequent implementations of the program (e.g., would a new implementation resemble Riverside?). I present a hierarchical model that lies between these two extremes. Using data from the Greater Avenues for Independence demonstration, I demonstrate that the model captures much of the site-to-site variation of the treatment effects but has less uncertainty than estimating the treatment effect separately for each site. I also show that when predictive uncertainty is ignored, the treatment impact for the Riverside sites is significant, but when predictive uncertainty is considered, the impact for these sites is insignificant. Finally, I demonstrate that the model extrapolates site effects with reasonable accuracy when the site being predicted does not differ substantially from the sites already observed. For example, the San Diego treatment effects could have been predicted based on their site characteristics, but the Riverside effects are consistently underpredicted.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore Bayesian inference in models with many instrumental variables that are potentially weakly correlated with the endogenous regressor. The prior distribution has a hierarchical (nested) structure. We apply the methods to the Angrist-Krueger (AK, 1991) analysis of returns to schooling using instrumental variables formed by interacting quarter of birth with state/year dummy variables. Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995) show that randomly generated instrumental variables, designed to match the AK data set, give two-stage least squares results that look similar to the results based on the actual instrumental variables. Using a hierarchical model with the AK data, we find a posterior distribution for the parameter of interest that is tight and plausible. Using data with randomly generated instruments, the posterior distribution is diffuse. Most of the information in the AK data can in fact be extracted with quarter of birth as the single instrumental variable. Using artificial data patterned on the AK data, we find that if all the information had been in the interactions between quarter of birth and state/year dummies, then the hierarchical model would still have led to precise inferences, whereas the single instrument model would have suggested that there was no information in the data. We conclude that hierarchical modeling is a conceptually straightforward way of efficiently combining many weak instrumental variables.},

Starting from simple examples, this chapter exploits the modularity of MCMC to build sophisticated discrete choice, self-selection, panel data and structural models that can be applied to a variety of topics. Emphasis is placed on cases for which estimation by MCMC has distinct benefits compared to the standard methods in the field. I conclude with a list of suggested applications.

	abstract = {For certain goods or services, the quality of the product can be assessed by customers only after consumption. We determine the optimal time paths for pricing, advertising and quality for a profit-maximizing firm facing demand that is influenced both by this experience quality as well as by advertising. In particular, there may exist two optimal trajectories separated by an indifference threshold in which the firm has the same utility of converging to either of the two long-run steady states. Or, to put it in a nutshell: the optimal mix of marketing instruments may lead to history-dependence. One implication is that there may be a market failure such that a government subsidy could help reach the steady state that is best for the Economy in the sense of having greater sales and a higher quality product.},
