	abstract = {Pumped hydropower storage can smooth output from intermittent renewable electricity generators and facilitate their large-scale use in energy systems. Germany has aggressive plans for wind power expansion, and pumped storage ramps quickly enough to smooth wind power and could profit from arbitrage on the short-term price fluctuations wind power strengthens. We consider five capacity alternatives for a pumped storage facility in Norway that practices arbitrage in the German spot market. Price forecasts given increased wind capacity are used to calculate profit-maximizing production schedules and annual revenue streams. Real options theory is used to value the investment opportunity, since unlike net present value, it accounts for uncertainty and intertemporal choice. Results show that the optimal investment strategy under the base scenario is to invest in the largest available plant approximately eight years into the option lifetime.},

We present a real options-based method with continuous scaling, and we find that there is a unique price limit for initiating the project. If the current electricity price is below this limit it is never optimal to invest, but above this limit investment is made according to the function for optimal size. The connection between the real option and the physical properties of a small hydropower plant is dealt with using a spreadsheet model that performs a technical simulation of the production in a plant, based on all the important choices for such a plant. The main results of the spreadsheet are simulated production size and the investment costs, which are in turn used for finding the value of the real option and the price limit. The method is illustrated on three different Norwegian small hydropower projects.},

The main purpose is to examine investment behavior under the most extensively employed support schemes, namely, feed-in tariffs and renewable energy certificate trading. We consider both multiple sources of uncertainty under each support scheme and uncertainty with respect to any change of support scheme, and we obtain both analytical (when possible) and numerical solutions. In a Nordic case study based on wind power, we find that the feed-in tariff encourages earlier investment. Nevertheless, as investment has been undertaken, renewable energy certificate trading creates incentives for larger projects. In our baseline scenario and taking the fixed feed-in tariff as a base, the revenue required to trigger investments is 61\% higher with renewable certificates. At the same time, investment capacity is 61\% higher.},

	annote = {identifies use of moral hazard in payday loans
Uses regression discontinuities to give causal interpretation - loans are given in 50 dollar increments up to half the lenders take-home pay. Substantially different loans for similar borrowers.



As the correlation between default and loan size combines the selection and incentive effects of loan size, we can, under reasonable assumptions, obtain an estimate of adverse selection by subtracting our moral-hazard estimates from the cross-sectional coefficient relating loan size and borrower default. 
 



we find that a \$50 increase in payday credit leads to a \$19.73 to \$22.02 increase in average loan size. Thus, payday borrowers borrow 39 to 44 cents per additional dollar of credit. These estimates are larger than previous findings using data from different types of debtors, likely reflecting the fact that payday borrowers are particularly credit constrained. 



 






Surprisingly, both our regression discontinuity and regression kink empirical strategies suggest that relaxing these credit constraints lowers the probability that a payday borrower defaults. A \$50 increase in payday-loan size leads to a 4.4 to 6.4 percentage point decrease in the probability of default in our regression discontinu- ity strategy sample, a 22 to 33 percent decrease. 
 



The finding that larger loans lower the rate of default is surprising given the prominence of moral hazard in the theoretical literature and the empirical relevance of moral hazard in other consumer-lending markets (Adams, Einav, and Levin, 2009). 
 



Conversely, we find economically and statistically significant adverse selection into larger payday loans. In our OLS results, which combine both adverse selection and moral hazard, a \$50 increase in loan size is associated with a 1.0 to 2.3 per- centage point increase in the probability of default in our regression discontinuity sample. 
 



Taken together with our estimates of moral hazard, this suggests that bor- rowers who choose a loan that is \$50 larger are 5.4 to 8.7 percentage points more likely to default, a 28 to 44 percent increase. In our regression kink sample, the OLS results suggest that borrowers who choose a \$50 larger loan are 16 to 47 per- cent more likely to default. Our results are therefore consistent with the view that adverse selection alone can lead to credit constraints in equilibrium. 






Adams, Einav, and Levin (2009), whose work is most closely related to ours, use price and down-payment variation across time, credit categories, and regions to identify the impact of moral hazard. 



 



Models of asymmetric information predict that information frictions will produce a positive correlation between loan default and the size or price of that loan.3 In the moral-hazard version of the model, individual borrowers are more likely to default on larger or more expensive loans. 
 
 



Consider the following model of the causal relationship between default (Di) and loan size (Li): 
(1) Di =a+gLi+ei 
The parameter of interest is g, which measures the causal effect of loan size on default (e.g., moral hazard). The problem for inference is that if individuals select a loan size because of important unobserved determinants of later outcomes, such estimates may be biased. In particular, it is plausible that people who select larger loans have a different probability of default even if loan size was held constant: E[ei{\textbar}Li] 6= 0. Since Li may be a function of default risk, this can lead to a bias in the direct estimation of g using OLS. 
The key intuition of our first strategy is that this bias can be overcome if the conditional distribution of unobserved determinants of default E[ei{\textbar}payi] trends smoothly through the loan-eligibility cutoffs used by payday lenders. In this sce- nario, the distribution of unobserved characteristics of individuals who just barely qualified for a larger loan is the same as the distribution among those who just barely did not qualify: 
(2) E[ei{\textbar}payi=cl+D]D!0+ =E[ei{\textbar}payi=clD]D!0+ 
 



The two-stage least squares regression controls for the underlying relationship between pay and both default and loan size using f(payi), and instruments for loan size using loan eligibility 
\{payi cl\} at each cutoff l.

Or, the average firm has present and future (up to five years) rent commitments equal to 16.6\% of their total assets. We investigate whether agency costs between the lessor and the lessee affect the lease intensity of firms. To do so, we examine the impact of firms' location on the use of operating leases. The main idea of our paper is that, because obtaining information and monitoring is costly for potential lessors, especially when a lessee is relatively far away from financial centers, rural firms are less likely to use operating leases. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that rural firms tend to have lower lease intensities than similar urban and small city firms. In addition, we find that firms with higher levels of debt capacity lease less and firms that face more financial constraint lease more. Our findings are robust to industry and lease maturity controls and consistent with the existence of an agency problem associated with leasing.},

While, like Kim (1985), the author assumed that the quality of a car depends on the maintenance level, the maintenance level in this model is chosen when a car is still a ‘new’ car, i.e. after the warranty ends. The model implied that the average quality of traded used cars can be either higher or lower than the average quality of nontraded used cars.

An important source of gains from trade in these markets is the heterogeneity in the willingness to pay for higher-quality (newer) goods, but transaction costs are an impediment to instantaneous trade. Calibration of the model successfully matches several aggregate features of the US and French used-car markets. Counterfactual analyses show that transaction costs have a large effect on volume of trade, allocations, and the primary market. Aggregate effects on consumer surplus and welfare are relatively small, but the effect on lower-valuation households can be large.},

In this paper we consider a model characterized by both adverse selection, as in these earlier papers, and moral hazard concerning the maintenance choices of new‐car drivers. We show that this approach provides explanations for a number of empirical findings concerning real‐world new‐ and used‐car markets, including that leasing has become more popular over time, very high income new‐car drivers lease more, and used cars that were leased when new sell for more than used cars that were purchased when new. We also compare and contrast our approach to new‐car leasing with alternative approaches.},

	abstract = {The act of trading in a used car as partial payment for a new car resonates with practically all consumers. Such transactions are prevalent in many other durable goods markets, ranging from golf clubs to CT scanners. What roles do trade-ins play in these markets? What motivates the seller to set up a channel to facilitate trade-ins? Intuitively, accepting a trade-in would appear to stimulate demand for the producer's product, but facilitating the resale of these used goods that substitute for new goods might also increase cannibalization. Although such transactions involve billions of dollars, we know relatively little about this practice from the extant research literature. This paper develops an analytical model that incorporates key features of real-world durable goods markets: (i) coexistence of new and used goods markets, (ii) consumer heterogeneity with respect to quality sensitivity, (iii) firms that anticipate the cannibalization problem arising from the coexistence of new and used goods, and (iv) lemon problems in resale markets, whereby sellers of used goods are better informed than buyers about the quality of their particular item. In our analysis, a trade-in policy amounts to an intervention by the firm in the used goods market, which reduces inefficiencies arising from the lemon problem. It motivates owners to purchase new goods and reduces their proclivity to hold on to purchased goods because of the low price the latter would fetch in a lemon market. We also show that trade-in programs are more valuable for less reliable products, as well as for products that deteriorate more slowly. Our analysis shows that producers in durable goods markets should consider trade-in programs as a matter of routine. Despite cannibalization concerns arising from a more active resale market, a producer's profits will inevitably rise from introducing trade-ins, given pervasive lemon problems. We test the key predictions of the model about price and volume of trade by assembling a data set of transactions of U.S. automobile consumers and find broad support for our model.},

Firms trade assets to adjust their productive capacity in response to shocks to profitability. Transaction costs hinder the efficiency of the allocation of capital, and lessors act as trading intermediaries who reduce trading frictions. The model predicts that leased assets trade more frequently and produce more output than owned assets, for two reasons. First, high-volatility firms are more likely to lease than low-volatility firms, since they expect to adjust their capacity more frequently. Second, ownership's larger transaction costs widen owners' inaction bands relative to lessees'.  Using data on commercial aircraft, I find that leased aircraft have holding durations 38-percent shorter and fly 6.5-percent more hours than owned aircraft. Additional tests indicate that most of these differential patterns in trading and utilization arise because owners have wider inaction bands than lessees, and carriers' self-selection into leasing plays a minor role.},

We argue that the benefit of leasing is that repossession of a leased asset is easier than foreclosure on the collateral of a secured loan, which implies that leasing has higher debt capacity than secured lending. However, leasing involves agency costs due to the separation of ownership and control. More financially constrained firms value the additional debt capacity more and hence lease more of their capital than less constrained firms. We provide empirical evidence consistent with this prediction. Our theory is consistent with the explanation of leasing by practitioners, namely that leasing “preserves capital,” which the academic literature considers a fallacy.},

Asymmetric information present in the market for used aircraft and leasing ameliorates the problem




Hendel and Lizzeri (2002) also show that leasing contracts, by increasing the average quality of durable goods transacted in used markets, serve to mitigate the con- sequences of adverse selection.




I test these predictions using data from the market for used business aircraft in North America over the period 1980–99. I find that qualitative uncertainty and leasing patterns exert a statistically significant effect on the relationship between depreciation and trading volume and that these effects are consistent with the predictions of the theory. 




First, evidence of the insights contained in Akerlof’s (1970) seminal work is mixed and inconclusive in contemporary durable goods markets. Bond (1984) finds weak evidence of adverse selection among older trucks only. Genesove (1993) finds only modest evidence of adverse selection in dealer auction markets for used cars. Fabel and Lehmann (2000) and Emons and Sheldon (2003) find stronger support for the existence of adverse se- lection in used automobile markets. 












Porter and Sattler (1999) argue that their results are inconsistent with adverse selection in used automobile markets. 




Second, counteracting or extramarket institutions are often under- stood as solving or mitigating problems of qualitative uncertainty and the asymmetric distribution of information. The market for business aircraft exhibits many of these features. For example, it is common for transactions of used business aircraft to carry some form of limited guarantee or warranty of serviceability and performance. 




 












Hendel and Lizzeri (1999, 2002) constitute a framework for assessing the relevance of adverse selection and, when proxies for qualitative uncertainty are present, for testing broader classes of theory pertaining to patterns of trade in used durable goods. 
 




Consumers with a strong preference for quality wish to frequently re- place durables that deteriorate rapidly. With full information, prices reflect this rapid deterioration, and brands with high trading volumes depreciate more quickly. 
 




Hendel and Lizzeri (2002) show that the percentage of durable good units returned to the lessor exceeds the percentage of units traded in the used market under standard selling contracts and, thus, that leasing contracts increase the volume of trade in used durable goods markets. 




 








that the regulatory history of a particular aircraft is an important indicator of its potential qualitative uncertainty. 
 




However, it is generally appreciated and easy to document that the cumulative number of airworthiness directives and the cumulative number of ac- cidents associated with any aircraft brand are highly correlated 
 




Thus entering the cumulative number of airworthiness directives directly into estimations of the residual value function serves to control for any correlation that may exist between aircraft quality and reliability and test the proposition that any measure of aircraft reliability should be directly related to aircraft value.
 




Thus the estimations reported below use aircraft age as a weight in the computation of standard errors and permit correlated (i.e., clustered) errors for given models of aircraft. 




 








The parameter on the interaction between the volume of trade and the cu- mulative number of airworthiness directives variables is statistically less than zero (.0012 and p ! .05). 
 




All else equal, aircraft brands with higher levels of qualitative uncertainty (i.e., larger values of the cumulative number of airworthiness directives variables) exhibit a more negative relationship between trading volume and estimated depreciation. The parameter on the interaction between the volume of trade and the number of lease-operated aircraft variables is statistically greater than zero (.0006, p ! .05). All else equal, aircraft models with higher leasing frequencies exhibit a more direct relationship between trading volume and depreciation rates. Both of these findings are consistent with the notion that asymmetric information is a prominent feature of and that leasing mitigates adverse selection in the used aircraft market.

As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

Taking a large economy limit, we show that (1) risk premiums equal products of betas and factor risk premiums, irrespective of information asymmetries; (2) holding total information constant, greater information asymmetry leads to higher factor risk premiums and, thus, higher costs of capital; and (3) controlling for betas, there is no crosssectional effect of information asymmetries on cost of capital. These results provide guidance in interpreting the findings of existing empirical work and suggest specifications helpful for future research.},

European Economic Review


This study uses a large sample of homes in the San Diego area and Sacramento, California area to provide some of the first capitalization estimates of the sales value of homes with solar panels relative to comparable homes without solar panels. Although the residential solar home market continues to grow, there is little direct evidence on the market capitalization effect. Using both hedonics and a repeat sales index approach we find that solar panels are capitalized at roughly a 3.5\% premium. This premium is larger in communities with a greater share of college graduates and of registered Prius hybrid vehicles. 


 



In this paper, we examine two aspects of solar purchases. We provide new hedonic marginal valuation estimates for a large sample of solar homes based on recent real estate transactions in San Diego County and Sacramento County. We document evidence of a solar price premium and find that this premium is larger in environmentalist communities. In most mature housing markets, we expect that the econometrician knows less about the market than the decision makers. In the case of solar panels, our interactions with professionals in the field suggests that these professionals have little basis for estimating the pecuniary benefits of solar installation. Our second empirical contribution is to document what types of people, in terms of education, political ideology and demographic attributes do and do not live in solar homes. Most hedonic studies that use sales data (rather than Census data) know very little about the household who actually lives in the home, but we can observe household characteristics for a single year. 
 



A distinctive feature of solar panels is that on a day to day basis they have no ‘‘use value’’ as compared to a new bathroom or kitchen. 
 



For those households who derive pleasure from knowing that they are generating their own electricity, the solar panels will yield ‘‘existence value’’. Such households will recognize that they have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions and thus are providing world public goods. 



-Incentive programs cover almost all installation in San Diego County



We find that households in which all voters are registered liberal and in which the household contributes to environmental organizations are much more likely to be in solar homes controlling for education, imputed income, the age of the oldest registered household member, and whether any children are present in the household









This study used a large sample of homes in the San Diego and Sacramento areas to provide some of the first capitalization estimates of the resale value of homes with solar panels relative to comparable homes without solar panels. Although the residential solar home market continues to grow, there is little direct evidence on the market capitalization effect. Using both hedonics and a repeat sales index approach we find that solar panels are capitalized at roughly a 3\% to 4\% premium. This premium is larger in communities with more registered Prius hybrid vehicles and in communities featuring a larger share of college graduates. 
Our new marginal valuation estimates inform the debate led by Borenstein (2008) on whether expenditure on residential solar is a ‘‘good investment.’’ His analysis evaluates residential solar installations solely as a ‘pure’ investment good judged in terms of upfront cost and subsequent power generation. Our evidence suggests that similar to other home investments such as a new kitchen, solar installation bundles both investment value and consumption value. Some households may take pride in knowing that they are producers of ‘‘green’’ electricity and ‘‘warm glow’’ may triumph over present discounted value calculations in determining a household’s install choice.

social interaction (peer) effects are recognized as a potentially important factor in the diffusion of new prod- ucts.

January 2006, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) established the California Solar Initiative (CSI), a \$3.3-billion, 10-year rebate program aiming to “install 3,000 megawatts (MW) of new solar over the next decade and to transform the mar- ket for solar energy by reducing the cost of solar” 
 




We leverage the fact that in the solar PV market, the decision to install solar panels does not lead to an instantaneous instal- lation, as a result of the time needed to complete the necessary paperwork and perform the installation. 
 




In our situation, we would not expect social interactions to have an effect until the solar PV panels have actually been installed, after which point the adopter would have experienced the benefits of the panels and neigh- bors may then be able to see the installation.

We further augment the installation data with zip code-level demographic data from Source- book America and American FactFinder, as well as data on hybrid vehicle registrations from R. L. Polk \& Co. 








The presence of peer effects should also imply accel- erating adoption in regions with more installations. 












quadratic term, implying increasing effects of new installations. In another specifica- tion we interact the installed base and year. Fig- ure 5 plots these coefficients9 with robust standard errors, again indicating that the installed base effect increases over time. Such an increase may derive from recent marketing efforts to leverage peer effects to induce adoptions. For example, one of the strate- gies employed by SolarCity (the largest installer in California) involves finding one or two vocal solar advocates in a neighborhood and giving the entire neighborhood a slightly lower price if enough adop- tions are made within that neighborhood. 
















The interaction with median income is economi- cally significant: running the regression on only the lower half of the zip code income distribution leads to a coefficient and standard error of 2.478 (0.680); for the top half, it is 1.243 (0.454). So although households with lower income may be less likely to adopt solar, they are more influenced by the peer effect. This is consistent with the high percentage of consumers naming finances as a primary reason for adopting solar, especially if the financial benefits of adoption are learned through information exchange.12 
If peer effects are a major factor underlying the clus- tering pattern in the data, we might expect to see evi- dence of peer effects at a more localized level than the zip code. With 2001–2006 address-level data from the California Energy Commission Emerging Renewables Program, we can examine how solar PV system adop- tion decisions are affected by the previous decisions of others on the same street. We define a street here as a street within a zip code, so that a long street that is in several zip codes is considered several separate streets. We create a panel data set where an obser- vation is a street-month.18 Table 8 provides summary 
 




This paper provides a straightforward methodology for consistently estimating peer effects in the adop- tion of new technologies that display a lag between the time of adoption and delivery, and then it quan- tifies the magnitude of those peer effects. We find strong evidence for causal peer effects, indicating that an extra installation in a zip code increases the probability of an adoption in the zip code by 0.78 per- centage points when evaluated at the average num- ber of owner-occupied homes in a zip code. These peer effects appear to increase in magnitude over time and are greater for larger installations and at the more localized street level. Our findings also indicate that peer effects appear to lead to larger installations. The results are suggestive of the pathways by which peer effects work: both visibility of the panels and word of mouth appear to contribute to social interac- tions that lead to further adoption. Accordingly, both image motivation and information transfer are likely to underlie the peer effects. These findings have clear implications for marketers who are striving to reduce the high cost of consumer acquisition in the solar PV market.

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

	abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds readers’ knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today’s model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.  The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.  By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.  Web ResourceThe book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author’s website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},
