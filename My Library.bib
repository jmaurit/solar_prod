	abstract = {In this paper we set out some methods that utilize the longitudinal structure of earnings of trainees and a comparison group to estimate the effectiveness of training for the 1976 cohort of CETA trainees. By fitting a components-of-variance model of earnings to the control group, and posing a simple model of program participation, we are able to predict the entire earnings histories of the trainees. The fit of these predictions to the pre-training earnings of the CETA participants provides a test of the model of earnings generation and program participation and simple check on the corresponding estimate of the effectiveness of training.Two factors appear to have a critical influence on the size of the estimated training effects: the time of the decision to participate in training and the presence or absence of individual-specific trends in earnings. We find considerable evidence that trainee earnings contain permanent, transitory,and trend-like components of selection bias. We are less successful in distinguishing empirically between alternative assumptions on the timing of the participation decision. If earnings in the year prior to training are the appropriate selection criterion, however, our estimate of the training effect for adult male CETA participants is about 300 dollars per year. Our estimates for female CETA participants are larger, and less sensitive to alternative models of program participation.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a generalization of the widely used difference-in-differences method for evaluating the effects of policy changes. We propose a model that allows the control and treatment groups to have different average benefits from the treatment. The assumptions of the proposed model are invariant to the scaling of the outcome. We provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria such as a mean–variance trade-off. We also propose methods for inference, showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal. We consider extensions to allow for covariates, discrete dependent variables, and multiple groups and time periods.},

	abstract = {Social scientists often estimate models from correlational data, where the independent variable has not been exogenously manipulated; they also make implicit or explicit causal claims based on these models. When can these claims be made? We answer this question by first discussing design and estimation conditions under which model estimates can be interpreted, using the randomized experiment as the gold standard. We show how endogeneity – which includes omitted variables, omitted selection, simultaneity, common-method variance, and measurement error – renders estimates causally uninterpretable. Second, we present methods that allow researchers to test causal claims in situations where randomization is not possible or when causal interpretation could be confounded; these methods include fixed-effects panel, sample selection, instrumental variable, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-differences models. Third, we take stock of the methodological rigor with which causal claims are being made in a social sciences discipline by reviewing a representative sample of 110 articles on leadership published in the previous 10 years in top-tier journals. Our key finding is that researchers fail to address at least 66\% and up to 90\% of design and estimation conditions that make causal claims invalid. We conclude by offering 10 suggestions on how to improve non-experimental research.},

We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.},

Borrowers choose the interest rate differential at which to refinance, and when that differential is reached, they need to take the steps to refinance before rates change again. Using a simple closed-form solution approximation of the optimal refinancing rule and a unique panel data set including information from a large secondary market participant on refinancing, we find that approximately 57\% of borrowers refinance suboptimally—50\% choose the wrong rate, 17\% wait too long to refinance, and 10\% do both. Financially sophisticated borrowers make smaller mistakes, refinancing at rates closer to optimal and waiting less after mortgage rates reach their trigger rates. Evidence suggests borrowers learn from their refinancing experiences. This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance.},

Yet the credibility of these reviews is fundamentally undermined when businesses commit review fraud, creating fake reviews for themselves or their competitors. We investigate the economic incentives to commit review fraud on the popular review platform Yelp, using two complementary approaches and data sets. We begin by analyzing restaurant reviews that are identified by Yelp’s filtering algorithm as suspicious, or fake—and treat these as a proxy for review fraud (an assumption we provide evidence for). We present four main findings. First, roughly 16\% of restaurant reviews on Yelp are filtered. These reviews tend to be more extreme (favorable or unfavorable) than other reviews, and the prevalence of suspicious reviews has grown significantly over time. Second, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when its reputation is weak, i.e., when it has few reviews or it has recently received bad reviews. Third, chain restaurants—which benefit less from Yelp—are also less likely to commit review fraud. Fourth, when restaurants face increased competition, they become more likely to receive unfavorable fake reviews. Using a separate data set, we analyze businesses that were caught soliciting fake reviews through a sting conducted by Yelp. These data support our main results and shed further light on the economic incentives behind a business’s decision to leave fake reviews. This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems.},

We also document that activists accumulate more stocks in targets when stock is more liquid. We conclude that liquidity helps overcome the free-rider problem and induces activism via preactivism accumulation of target firms' shares.},

In high social capital areas, banks raise more deposits locally, distribute more of their surplus for altruistic purposes, and operate more locally focused branch networks.},

Nodes represent participants in the network, and weighted directed edges represent liabilities. Often, for every participant, only the total liabilities and total assets within this network are observable. However, systemic risk assessment needs the individual liabilities. We propose a model for the individual liabilities, which, following a Bayesian approach, we then condition on the observed total liabilities and assets and, potentially, on certain observed individual liabilities. We construct a Gibbs sampler to generate samples from this conditional distribution. These samples can be used in stress testing, giving probabilities for the outcomes of interest. As one application we derive default probabilities of individual banks and discuss their sensitivity with respect to prior information included to model the network. An R package implementing the methodology is provided. This paper was accepted by Noah Gans, stochastic models and simulation.},

The proposed model and estimation method are applied to the 32/64-bit generation of the U.S. video game industry.

	abstract = {While statisticians and quantitative social scientists typically study the “effects of causes” (EoC), Lawyers and the Courts are more concerned with understanding the “causes of effects” (CoE). EoC can be addressed using experimental design and statistical analysis, but it is less clear how to incorporate statistical or epidemiological evidence into CoE reasoning, as might be required for a case at Law. Some form of counterfactual reasoning, such as the “potential outcomes” approach championed by Rubin, appears unavoidable, but this typically yields “answers” that are sensitive to arbitrary and untestable assumptions. We must therefore recognise that a CoE question simply might not have a well-determined answer. It is nevertheless possible to use statistical data to set bounds within which any answer must lie. With less than perfect data these bounds will themselves be uncertain, leading to a compounding of different kinds of uncertainty. Still further care is required in the presence of possible confounding factors. In addition, even identifying the relevant “counterfactual contrast” may be a matter of Policy as much as of Science. Defining the question is as non-trivial a task as finding a route towards an answer. This paper develops some technical elaborations of these philosophical points from a personalist Bayesian perspective, and illustrates them with a Bayesian analysis of a case study in child protection.},

	abstract = {Policy uncertainty can be a powerful deterrent to immediate investments. Based on panel data of 214 licenses to construct small run-of-the-river hydropower plants, we examine whether the prospect of a common Swedish–Norwegian market for green certificates (i.e., a renewable portfolio standard scheme) affected the timing of investments. Our results show that traditional utilities and other professional investors in the energy market acted in accordance with a real options investment rule, and the prospect of possible future subsidies delayed their investment decision. On the other hand, our results do not show that farmers and other non-professional investors incorporated timing considerations in their investment decisions. Rather, our results indicate that these investors behaved as if their investment opportunity is now-or-never, investing if the project is profitable according to a net present value investment rule, ignoring the opportunity to create additional value by waiting. The observed difference in behavior between professional and non-professional investors is interesting given the distributed nature of many renewable energy technologies, and can help planners and policymakers better understand the forces shaping the future market for electricity.},

The value of the concession, which is the right to use water, is also assessed on the basis of a real option analysis including a long-term horizon.

	annote = {identifies use of moral hazard in payday loans
Uses regression discontinuities to give causal interpretation - loans are given in 50 dollar increments up to half the lenders take-home pay. Substantially different loans for similar borrowers.



As the correlation between default and loan size combines the selection and incentive effects of loan size, we can, under reasonable assumptions, obtain an estimate of adverse selection by subtracting our moral-hazard estimates from the cross-sectional coefficient relating loan size and borrower default. 
 



we find that a \$50 increase in payday credit leads to a \$19.73 to \$22.02 increase in average loan size. Thus, payday borrowers borrow 39 to 44 cents per additional dollar of credit. These estimates are larger than previous findings using data from different types of debtors, likely reflecting the fact that payday borrowers are particularly credit constrained. 



 






Surprisingly, both our regression discontinuity and regression kink empirical strategies suggest that relaxing these credit constraints lowers the probability that a payday borrower defaults. A \$50 increase in payday-loan size leads to a 4.4 to 6.4 percentage point decrease in the probability of default in our regression discontinu- ity strategy sample, a 22 to 33 percent decrease. 
 



The finding that larger loans lower the rate of default is surprising given the prominence of moral hazard in the theoretical literature and the empirical relevance of moral hazard in other consumer-lending markets (Adams, Einav, and Levin, 2009). 
 



Conversely, we find economically and statistically significant adverse selection into larger payday loans. In our OLS results, which combine both adverse selection and moral hazard, a \$50 increase in loan size is associated with a 1.0 to 2.3 per- centage point increase in the probability of default in our regression discontinuity sample. 
 



Taken together with our estimates of moral hazard, this suggests that bor- rowers who choose a loan that is \$50 larger are 5.4 to 8.7 percentage points more likely to default, a 28 to 44 percent increase. In our regression kink sample, the OLS results suggest that borrowers who choose a \$50 larger loan are 16 to 47 per- cent more likely to default. Our results are therefore consistent with the view that adverse selection alone can lead to credit constraints in equilibrium. 






Adams, Einav, and Levin (2009), whose work is most closely related to ours, use price and down-payment variation across time, credit categories, and regions to identify the impact of moral hazard. 



 



Models of asymmetric information predict that information frictions will produce a positive correlation between loan default and the size or price of that loan.3 In the moral-hazard version of the model, individual borrowers are more likely to default on larger or more expensive loans. 
 
 



Consider the following model of the causal relationship between default (Di) and loan size (Li): 
(1) Di =a+gLi+ei 
The parameter of interest is g, which measures the causal effect of loan size on default (e.g., moral hazard). The problem for inference is that if individuals select a loan size because of important unobserved determinants of later outcomes, such estimates may be biased. In particular, it is plausible that people who select larger loans have a different probability of default even if loan size was held constant: E[ei{\textbar}Li] 6= 0. Since Li may be a function of default risk, this can lead to a bias in the direct estimation of g using OLS. 
The key intuition of our first strategy is that this bias can be overcome if the conditional distribution of unobserved determinants of default E[ei{\textbar}payi] trends smoothly through the loan-eligibility cutoffs used by payday lenders. In this sce- nario, the distribution of unobserved characteristics of individuals who just barely qualified for a larger loan is the same as the distribution among those who just barely did not qualify: 
(2) E[ei{\textbar}payi=cl+D]D!0+ =E[ei{\textbar}payi=clD]D!0+ 
 



The two-stage least squares regression controls for the underlying relationship between pay and both default and loan size using f(payi), and instruments for loan size using loan eligibility 
\{payi cl\} at each cutoff l.

His ideas have had a profound impact on many fields-including business, medicine, and politics-but until now, he has never brought together his many years of research in one book.In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think and make choices. One system is fast, intuitive, and emotional; the other is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities-and also the faults and biases-of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour. The importance of properly framing risks, the effects of cognitive biases on how we view others, the dangers of prediction, the right ways to develop skills, the pros and cons of fear and optimism, the difference between our experience and memory of events, the real components of happiness-each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.Drawing on a lifetime's experimental experience, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our professional and our personal lives-and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you take decisions and experience the world.},

	abstract = {U.S. firms lease assets extensively. We find that, during 1980–2011, the average U.S. firm has a lease intensity of about 40\%. Or, the average firm has present and future (up to five years) rent commitments equal to 16.6\% of their total assets. We investigate whether agency costs between the lessor and the lessee affect the lease intensity of firms. To do so, we examine the impact of firms' location on the use of operating leases. The main idea of our paper is that, because obtaining information and monitoring is costly for potential lessors, especially when a lessee is relatively far away from financial centers, rural firms are less likely to use operating leases. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that rural firms tend to have lower lease intensities than similar urban and small city firms. In addition, we find that firms with higher levels of debt capacity lease less and firms that face more financial constraint lease more. Our findings are robust to industry and lease maturity controls and consistent with the existence of an agency problem associated with leasing.},

The author assumed that a consumer can buy or lease a new car, or he/she can buy a used or a CPO car. While, like Kim (1985), the author assumed that the quality of a car depends on the maintenance level, the maintenance level in this model is chosen when a car is still a ‘new’ car, i.e. after the warranty ends. The model implied that the average quality of traded used cars can be either higher or lower than the average quality of nontraded used cars. The study also found that leasing and CPO have substantially improved the information mechanism between buyers and sellers of used cars, which, in turn, has helped reduce adverse selection and improved the average quality of traded used cars in the market.},

We use the exemption at age 18 to estimate the impact of tort liability on accidents as well as on a wide variety of behaviors and safety investments by pilots and owners. The results are consistent with moral hazard. When an aircraft is exempted from tort liability, the probability that the aircraft will be involved in an accident declines.

	abstract = {The act of trading in a used car as partial payment for a new car resonates with practically all consumers. Such transactions are prevalent in many other durable goods markets, ranging from golf clubs to CT scanners. What roles do trade-ins play in these markets? What motivates the seller to set up a channel to facilitate trade-ins? Intuitively, accepting a trade-in would appear to stimulate demand for the producer's product, but facilitating the resale of these used goods that substitute for new goods might also increase cannibalization. Although such transactions involve billions of dollars, we know relatively little about this practice from the extant research literature. This paper develops an analytical model that incorporates key features of real-world durable goods markets: (i) coexistence of new and used goods markets, (ii) consumer heterogeneity with respect to quality sensitivity, (iii) firms that anticipate the cannibalization problem arising from the coexistence of new and used goods, and (iv) lemon problems in resale markets, whereby sellers of used goods are better informed than buyers about the quality of their particular item. In our analysis, a trade-in policy amounts to an intervention by the firm in the used goods market, which reduces inefficiencies arising from the lemon problem. It motivates owners to purchase new goods and reduces their proclivity to hold on to purchased goods because of the low price the latter would fetch in a lemon market. We also show that trade-in programs are more valuable for less reliable products, as well as for products that deteriorate more slowly. Our analysis shows that producers in durable goods markets should consider trade-in programs as a matter of routine. Despite cannibalization concerns arising from a more active resale market, a producer's profits will inevitably rise from introducing trade-ins, given pervasive lemon problems. We test the key predictions of the model about price and volume of trade by assembling a data set of transactions of U.S. automobile consumers and find broad support for our model.},

Firms trade assets to adjust their productive capacity in response to shocks to profitability. Transaction costs hinder the efficiency of the allocation of capital, and lessors act as trading intermediaries who reduce trading frictions. The model predicts that leased assets trade more frequently and produce more output than owned assets, for two reasons. First, high-volatility firms are more likely to lease than low-volatility firms, since they expect to adjust their capacity more frequently. Second, ownership's larger transaction costs widen owners' inaction bands relative to lessees'.  Using data on commercial aircraft, I find that leased aircraft have holding durations 38-percent shorter and fly 6.5-percent more hours than owned aircraft. Additional tests indicate that most of these differential patterns in trading and utilization arise because owners have wider inaction bands than lessees, and carriers' self-selection into leasing plays a minor role.},

More financially constrained firms value the additional debt capacity more and hence lease more of their capital than less constrained firms.

Asymmetric information present in the market for used aircraft and leasing ameliorates the problem




Hendel and Lizzeri (2002) also show that leasing contracts, by increasing the average quality of durable goods transacted in used markets, serve to mitigate the con- sequences of adverse selection.




I test these predictions using data from the market for used business aircraft in North America over the period 1980–99. I find that qualitative uncertainty and leasing patterns exert a statistically significant effect on the relationship between depreciation and trading volume and that these effects are consistent with the predictions of the theory. 




First, evidence of the insights contained in Akerlof’s (1970) seminal work is mixed and inconclusive in contemporary durable goods markets. Bond (1984) finds weak evidence of adverse selection among older trucks only. Genesove (1993) finds only modest evidence of adverse selection in dealer auction markets for used cars. Fabel and Lehmann (2000) and Emons and Sheldon (2003) find stronger support for the existence of adverse se- lection in used automobile markets. 












Porter and Sattler (1999) argue that their results are inconsistent with adverse selection in used automobile markets. 




Second, counteracting or extramarket institutions are often under- stood as solving or mitigating problems of qualitative uncertainty and the asymmetric distribution of information. The market for business aircraft exhibits many of these features. For example, it is common for transactions of used business aircraft to carry some form of limited guarantee or warranty of serviceability and performance. 




 












Hendel and Lizzeri (1999, 2002) constitute a framework for assessing the relevance of adverse selection and, when proxies for qualitative uncertainty are present, for testing broader classes of theory pertaining to patterns of trade in used durable goods. 
 




Consumers with a strong preference for quality wish to frequently re- place durables that deteriorate rapidly. With full information, prices reflect this rapid deterioration, and brands with high trading volumes depreciate more quickly. 
 




Hendel and Lizzeri (2002) show that the percentage of durable good units returned to the lessor exceeds the percentage of units traded in the used market under standard selling contracts and, thus, that leasing contracts increase the volume of trade in used durable goods markets. 




 








that the regulatory history of a particular aircraft is an important indicator of its potential qualitative uncertainty. 
 




However, it is generally appreciated and easy to document that the cumulative number of airworthiness directives and the cumulative number of ac- cidents associated with any aircraft brand are highly correlated 
 




Thus entering the cumulative number of airworthiness directives directly into estimations of the residual value function serves to control for any correlation that may exist between aircraft quality and reliability and test the proposition that any measure of aircraft reliability should be directly related to aircraft value.
 




Thus the estimations reported below use aircraft age as a weight in the computation of standard errors and permit correlated (i.e., clustered) errors for given models of aircraft. 




 








The parameter on the interaction between the volume of trade and the cu- mulative number of airworthiness directives variables is statistically less than zero (.0012 and p ! .05). 
 




All else equal, aircraft brands with higher levels of qualitative uncertainty (i.e., larger values of the cumulative number of airworthiness directives variables) exhibit a more negative relationship between trading volume and estimated depreciation. The parameter on the interaction between the volume of trade and the number of lease-operated aircraft variables is statistically greater than zero (.0006, p ! .05). All else equal, aircraft models with higher leasing frequencies exhibit a more direct relationship between trading volume and depreciation rates. Both of these findings are consistent with the notion that asymmetric information is a prominent feature of and that leasing mitigates adverse selection in the used aircraft market.

Recommendations are made for revisions in the subsidy programme that would encourage more efficient use of subsidy funds. /// Ausgehend von der Tatsache, daß während der 70er Jahre die Subventionen an den öffentlichen Personennahverkehr in den USA um das 15fache stiegen, vermuten die Verfasser, daß die staatlichen Unterstützungen die Produktivitäts- und Kostenprobleme nur noch verschärft haben. Dadurch wird der potentielle Nutzen der Subventionen konterkariert.

	abstract = {An effective energy technology strategy has to balance between setting a stable long term framework for innovation, while also responding to more immediate changes in technology cost and performance. Over the last decade, rather than a steady progression along an established learning curve, PV costs and prices have been volatile, with increases or plateaus followed by rapid reductions. The paper describes, and considers the causes of, recent changes in PV costs and prices at module and system level, both international trends and more place-specific contexts. It finds that both module and system costs and price trends have reflected multiple overlapping forces. Established forecasting methods – experience curves and engineering assessments – have limited ability to capture key learning effects behind recent PV cost and price trends: production scale effects, industrial re-organization and shakeouts, international trade practices and national market dynamics. These forces are likely to remain prominent aspect of technology learning effects in the foreseeable future – and so are in need of improved, more explicit representation in energy technology forecasting.},

The current operational model of demand for health insurance shows that the tax subsidy does substantially increase insurance coverage. Since much of the rise in health care costs can be attributed to the growth of insurance, the tax subsidy is responsible for much of what is widely perceived as a health care crisis.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the depth and duration of the slump that invariably follows severe financial crises, which tend to be protracted affairs. We find that asset market collapses are deep and prolonged. On a peak-to-trough basis, real housing price declines average 35 percent stretched out over six years, while equity price collapses average 55 percent over a downturn of about three and a half years. Not surprisingly, banking crises are associated with profound declines in output and employment. The unemployment rate rises an average of 7 percentage points over the down phase of the cycle, which lasts on average over four years. Output falls an average of over 9 percent, although the duration of the downturn is considerably shorter than for unemployment. The real value of government debt tends to explode, rising an average of 86 percent in the major post-World War II episodes. The main cause of debt explosions is usually not the widely cited costs of bailing out and recapitalizing the banking system. The collapse in tax revenues in the wake of deep and prolonged economic contractions is a critical factor in explaining the large budget deficits and increases in debt that follow the crisis. Our estimates of the rise in government debt are likely to be conservative, as these do not include increases in government guarantees, which also expand briskly during these episodes.},

	abstract = {Third-party photovoltaics (PV) ownership is a rapidly growing market trend, where commercial companies own and operate customer-sited PV systems and lease PV equipment or sell PV electricity to the building occupant. Third-party PV companies can reduce or eliminate up-front adoption costs, reduce technology risk and complexity by monitoring system performance, and can repackage the PV value proposition by showing cost savings in the first month of ownership rather than payback times on the order of a decade. We find that the entrance of third-party business models in southern California residential PV markets has enticed a new demographic to adopt PV systems that is more highly correlated to younger, less affluent, and less educated populations than the demographics correlated to purchasing PV systems. By enticing new demographics to adopt PV, we find that third-party PV products are likely increasing total PV demand rather than gaining market share entirely at the expense of existing customer owned PV demand. We also find that mean population demographics are good predictors of third-party and customer owned PV adoption, and mean voting trends on California carbon policy (Proposition 23) are poor predictors of PV adoption.},

Over 20 years, these additional installations reduce carbon dioxide emissions between 2.3 and 3.4 million metric tons and local air pollutants (NOx) by 1,100 to 1,700 metric tons. Of the \$440 million in rebates awarded, \$121 million were rents to installations that would have occurred absent rebates.

However, significant interactions may arise between the policy instruments used (Emissions Trading Scheme and RES-specific measures), such as double-counting incentives or geographical overlapping. This article examines these interactions using analytical and simulation research and offers some policy recommendations. The major conclusions are that both instruments are required in order to meet the objectives, and that their use in combination may be advantageous regarding consumer costs. However, they must be carefully coordinated, since part of the carbon allowance price may be incorporated into the RES certificate price. This will produce a reduction in the strength of the emissions reduction signal, and also a different distribution of the cost of the policies. In addition, each policy needs to focus at the geographical level appropriate for its objectives (carbon and security of supply policies at the regional level, and RES-induced local development at the national level).},

However, because of different regulatory environments, energy resource endowments, political interests, and other factors, there is considerable variation among the states in their green power policies. This paper analyzes the contribution to wind power development of several state-level policies (renewable portfolio standards (RPS), fuel generation disclosure rules, mandatory green power options, and public benefits funds), along with retail choice (RET) facilitated by electricity restructuring. The empirical results support existing anecdotal and case studies in finding a positive relationship between RPS and wind power development. We also found that requiring electricity suppliers to provide green power options to customers is positively related to development of wind energy, while there is a negative relationship between wind energy development and RET (i.e., allowing retail customers to choose their electricity source).},

One line of argument is that deployment of these resources may lead to reductions in the demand for and price of natural gas. Many recent US-based modeling studies have demonstrated that this effect could provide significant consumer savings. In this article we evaluate these studies, and benchmark their findings against economic theory, other modeling results, and a limited empirical literature. We find that many uncertainties remain regarding the absolute magnitude of this effect, and that the reduction in natural gas prices may not represent an increase in aggregate economic wealth. Nonetheless, we conclude that many of the studies of the impact of renewable energy on natural gas prices appear to have represented this effect within reason, given current knowledge. These studies specifically suggest that a 1\% reduction in US natural gas demand could lead to long-term average wellhead price reductions of 0.8–2\%, and that each megawatt-hour of renewable energy may benefit natural gas consumers to the tune of at least \$7.5–20.},

A knee of the cost curve exists between 15\% and 20\% goals for 2020 in our central case, and higher natural gas prices lower the cost of greater reliance on renewables. A renewable energy production tax credit lowers electricity price at the expense of taxpayers, which limits its effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions, and it is less cost-effective at increasing renewables than a portfolio standard. Neither policy is as cost-effective as a cap-and-trade policy for achieving carbon emission reductions.},

	abstract = {Recently enacted state renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) collectively require that U.S. electricity generation by non-hydro renewables more than double by 2025. These goals are not certain to be met, however, because many RPSs apply cost caps that alter requirements if costs exceed targets. We analyze here the 2008 Illinois RPS, which is fairly typical, and find that at current electricity prices, complete implementation will require significant decreases in renewables costs even given the continuation of federal renewables subsidies. Full implementation is possible but not assured. The statutory design raises additional concerns about unintended potential consequences. The fact that windpower and solar carveouts fall under a single cost cap means that in failure mode, a less cost-effective technology can curtail deployment of a more cost-effective one. Adjacent-state provisions mean the bulk of the RPS can be met by existing wind facilities, and that new wind builds will likely occur in Iowa. The Illinois RPS, like that of many other states, appears to combine objectives inherently in conflict: preferences for local jobs, for specific technologies, for environmental benefits, and for low costs. Revisiting the legislation may be needed to make legislative success likely and to ensure that failure modes do not compromise goals.},

	abstract = {Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) are popular market-based mechanisms for promoting development of renewable power generation. However, they are usually implemented without considering the capabilities and cost of transmission infrastructure. We use single- and multi-stage planning approaches to find cost-effective transmission and generation investments to meet single and multi-year RPS goals, respectively. Using a six-node network and assuming a linearized DC power flow, we examine how the lumpy nature of network reinforcements and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law can affect the performance of RPSs. First, we show how simplified planning approaches that ignore transmission constraints, transmission lumpiness, or Kirchhoff’s voltage law yield distorted estimates of the type and location of infrastructure, as well as inaccurate compliance costs to meet the renewable goals. Second, we illustrate how lumpy transmission investments and Kirchhoff’s voltage law result in compliance costs that are nonconvex with respect to the RPS targets, in the sense that the marginal costs of meeting the RPS may decrease rather than increase as the target is raised. Thus, the value of renewable energy certificates (RECs) also depends on the network topology, as does the amount of noncompliance with the RPS, if noncompliance is penalized but not prohibited. Finally, we use a multi-stage planning model to determine the optimal generation and transmission infrastructure for RPS designs that set multiyear goals. We find that the optimal infrastructure to meet RPS policies that are enforced year-by-year differ from the optimal infrastructure if banking and borrowing is allowed in the REC market.},

This paper applies both an analytical model and a computational model to examine the short-run implications of market interactions and policy redundancy. The analytical model is used to generate contestable hypotheses, while the numerical model is applied to consider more realistic market conditions. We have two central findings. First, lowering the CO2 C\&amp;T cap might penalize renewable units, and increasing the RPS level could sometimes benefit coal and oil and make natural gas units worse off. Second, making one policy more stringent would weaken the market incentive, which the other policy relies upon to attain its intended policy target.},

We are able to control for heterogeneity in the data by incorporating variables which account for both the geological features of each field and individual operator characteristics. The results indicate that the expected price of oil and the level of reserves are important in influencing the appraisal duration but that the variance of the oil price is not. Variables capturing the non-economic features of the individual fields are also found to be significant factors affecting the appraisal lag.},

The sample period, unlike Griffin's, however, includes phases of price increase (1970s) and price decrease (1980s–1990s), thus providing a better framework for examining production behavior using the competitive model. The OPEC results do not support the competitive hypothesis; instead, a negative and significant price elasticity of supply is obtained. This result offers partial support for the target revenue theory. For most of the non-OPEC members, the estimates support the competitive model. OPEC's loss of market share and the drop in the share of oil-based energy should signal adjustments in price and quantity based on a competitive world market for crude oil.},

In this paper, we specify and estimate an econometric model of exploration and appraisal drilling for the highly regulated Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) over the period 1965 to 2004. Explanatory variables include the oil price, cumulative discoveries and open exploration acreage. Estimated error-correction models account explicitly for sluggishness and short-term adjustments in exploration drilling. We find robust long-term oil price effects on exploration activity, whereas the short-term response is muted. On the other hand, the temporary influence on exploration drilling from licensing rounds for new exploration acreage is significant, and so are the feedback effects from historical exploration success. At the same time, the longer-term impact of these variables is more moderate.},

	abstract = {The giant oil fields of the world are only a small fraction of the total number of fields, but their importance is huge. Over 50\% of the world’s oil production came from giants by 2005 and more than half of the world’s ultimate reserves are found in giants. Based on this, it is reasonable to assume that the future development of the giant oil fields will have a significant impact on the world oil supply. In order to better understand the giant fields and their future behavior, one must first understand their history. This study has used a comprehensive database on giant oil fields in order to determine their typical parameters, such as the average decline rate and life-times of giants. The evolution of giant oil field behavior has been investigated to better understand future behavior. One conclusion is that new technology and production methods have generally led to high depletion rates and rapid decline. The historical trend points towards high decline rates of fields currently on plateau production. The peak production generally occurs before half the ultimate reserves have been produced in giant oil fields. A strong correlation between depletion-at-peak and average decline rate is also found, verifying that high depletion rate leads to rapid decline. Our result also implies that depletion analysis can be used to rule out unrealistic production expectations from a known reserve, or to connect an estimated production level to a needed reserve base.},

Oil was first discovered in the North Sea in late 1960s and the rapid expansion of Norwegian oil production lead to the low oil prices in the beginning of the 1990s. In 2001, Norway reached its peak production and began to decline.

The Norwegian oil production can be broken up into four subclasses; giant oil fields, smaller oil fields, natural gas liquids and condensate. The production of each subclass was analyzed to find typical behaviour and decline rates. The typical decline rates of giant oil fields were found to be −13\% annually. The other subclasses decline equally fast or even faster, especially condensate with typical decline rates of −40\% annually. The conclusion from the forecast is that Norway will have dramatically reduced export volume of oil by 2030.},

The model treats additions to proven oil reserves as output of a production process in which drilling wells is a primary input to transform some of oil-in-place into the economic category of proven reserves. Application of the model to US data for the 1950–1995 period provides strong statistical support for the existence of all the three salient effects. We obtain an estimate of the price elasticity of reserve additions (absent from previous studies) which, although statistically highly significant, is rather small. Using this price elasticity estimate, it is shown that if in the face of steady economic growth, and hence, oil consumption, US oil import dependence is to be kept from rising in the future, ceteris paribus, a steady oil price increase in the range of 1.5–4.5\% a year is essential.},

We find strong evidence for changes in persistence and in volatility of price across three well defined periods. We argue that historically, the real price of oil has tended to be highly persistent and volatile whenever rapid industrialization in a major world economy coincided with uncertainty regarding access to supply. We present a modified commodity storage model that fully incorporates demand, and further can accommodate both transitory and permanent shocks. We show that the role of storage when demand is subject to persistent growth shocks is speculative, instead of its classic mitigating role. This result helps to account for the increased volatility of oil price we observe in these periods.},

The following types of models are reviewed: the Hubbert method; other curve-fitting methods such as exponential and Gaussian models; simulation models of resource discovery and extraction; and data-rich “bottom-up” models. Economic models are reviewed more briefly. Forty-five mathematical models of oil depletion of the last century are classified along four dimensions of variability: emphasis on physical or economic aspects of oil production; model scale; hypothetical or mechanistic orientation; and complexity. Models based on quite disparate assumptions (e.g., physical simulation vs. economic optimal depletion) have produced approximately bell-shaped production profiles, but data do not support assertions that any one model type is most useful for forecasting future oil production. In fact, evidence suggests that existing models have fared poorly in predicting global oil production. The greatest promise for future developments in oil depletion modeling lies in simulation models that combine both physical and economic aspects of oil production.},

In this paper, three assumptions of the modern Hubbert theory are tested using data from 139 oil producing regions. These regions are sub-national (United States state-level, United States regional-level), national, and multi-national (subcontinental and continental) in scale. We test the assumption that oil production follows a bell-shaped curve by generating best-fitting curves for each region using six models and comparing the quality of fit across models. We also test the assumptions that production over time in a region tends to be symmetric, and that production is more bell-shaped in larger regions than in smaller regions.},

Hubbert in the 1950s as a way to describe the production pattern of crude oil. According to Hubbert, the production curve is “bell shaped” and approximately symmetric. Hubbert's theory was verified with good approximation for the case of oil production in the United States that peaked in 1971, and is now being applied to the worldwide oil production. It is generally believed that the global peak of oil production (“peak oil”) will take place during the first decade of the 21st century, and some analysts believe that it has already occurred in 2005 or 2006. The theory and its consequences have unpleasant social and economical implications. The present paper is not aimed at assessing the peak date but offers a discussion on the factors that affect the acceptance and the diffusion of the concept of “peak oil” with experts and with the general public. The discussion is based on a subdivision of “four stages of acceptance”, loosely patterned after a sentence by Thomas Huxley.},

Investments in new wind-power installations on land, however, have declined dramatically after the Danish electricity market was liberalised in 1999. First, the paper describes how policy measures directed towards wind power have been redesigned to match the liberalised market. Then, we estimate the impact of the redesigned tariffs on the electricity prices. Finally, we assess whether the new tariffs make an incentive to invest in wind power. The paper concludes that the new tariffs not by itself make evidence for the actual Danish recession in new wind-power installations after the electricity reform. The main causes could include a combination of problems in spatial planning, high risk aversion of new wind turbine investors and perhaps more favourable support schemes in other countries.},

The two principal lines of thought on short-term prediction (mathematical and physical) are indistinctly treated here and comparisons between models and tools are avoided, mainly because, on the one hand, a standard for a measure of performance is still not adopted and, on the other hand, it is very important that the data are exactly the same in order to compare two models (this fact makes it almost impossible to carry out a quantitative comparison between a huge number of models and methods). In place of a quantitative description, a qualitative approach is preferred for this review, remarking the contribution (and innovative aspect) of each model. On the basis of the review, some topics for future research are pointed out.},

	abstract = {In leading European wind power countries wind power generation affects wholesale power prices already today. First investigations indicate that the respective wind power - price relation lowers the market value of wind power relative to the baseload price with increasing penetration. The aim of this paper is to identify parameters that determine this effect based on simulations for the Central European Power Market (CEPM). We model wind power - price interactions and investigate the sensitivity of the market value on a number of wind power and system related parameters. The market value of wind power is sensitive to changes in wind share and variability, wind-demand correlation and the supply characteristics. Results further indicate that for expected wind capacities in 2020 the market value in the CEPM is significantly lower than the baseload price. The market value reducing effect varies among countries and is comparably low for wind power portfolios whose generation is weakly correlated with the overall wind power generation in the respective power market. Hence with rising wind shares it will become increasingly important to take this effect into account when assessing the economics of wind power projects. Future trends in the CEPM that may positively influence the market value are increasing electricity demand, fuel and CO2 prices, a better geographic distribution of onshore wind within the CEPM and an increasing utilization of offshore wind.},

An asymptotic theory is developed for regressions that relate quite general integrated random processes. This includes the spurious regressions of Granger and Newbold (1974) and the recent cointegrating regressions of Granger and Engle (1985). An asymptotic theory is developed for the regression coefficients and for conventional significance tests. It is shown that the usual t- and F-ratio test statistics do not possess limiting distributions in this context but actually diverge as the sample size T [short up arrow] [infinity]. The limiting behavior of regression diagnostics such as the Durbin-Watson statistic, the coefficient of determination and the Box-Pierce statistic is also analyzed. The theoretical results that we present explain many of the earlier simulation findings of Granger and Newbold, 1974 and Granger and Newbold, 1977.},

This simple hypothesis captures the essence of the important idea that the life spans of durable goods are determined by both economic and technical considerations. We present empirical evidence based on an explicit econometric model of the scrappage decision. Analyzing make-model-vintage specific scrappage rates in Israel for 1979, we find that the hypothesized inverse relationship between price and scrappage probability exists and is of striking magnitude. This finding, when combined with the fact that new car prices in Israel are almost triple CIF prices, may explain why the median life expectancy of a vehicle in Israel is so much longer than that of a similar vehicle in Western Europe or the United States.},

	abstract = {Wind power has a strong position at the Danish electricity market, mainly caused by high feed-in tariffs in the 1990s. Investments in new wind-power installations on land, however, have declined dramatically after the Danish electricity market was liberalised in 1999. First, the paper describes how policy measures directed towards wind power have been redesigned to match the liberalised market. Then, we estimate the impact of the redesigned tariffs on the electricity prices. Finally, we assess whether the new tariffs make an incentive to invest in wind power. The paper concludes that the new tariffs not by itself make evidence for the actual Danish recession in new wind-power installations after the electricity reform. The main causes could include a combination of problems in spatial planning, high risk aversion of new wind turbine investors and perhaps more favourable support schemes in other countries.},

Is it possible to establish a relation between turbine economy and the capacity expansion that could be used for regulatory purposes in reaching a specific policy-determined target for the deployment of wind power? Such relations are analysed with reference to three types of turbine ownership: Co-operatives, individuals (e.g. a farmer), and utility companies. The paper concludes that concerning individually owned turbines, a strong relationship between wind turbine profitability and the annual capacity development does exist. With regard to investments in co-operatively owned turbines, only a weak relationship was found. Other determining factors, such as those related to the environment, might be more important as inputs to the decision-making process when turbine co-operatives are established. The turbines established by the utilities are not treated in detail here, because this capacity development is determined mainly by the power companies' agreements with the Government. Finally, the paper concludes that the estimated relationship between profitability and capacity increase for individually owned turbines possibly might be used for regulatory purposes in reaching a specific target for capacity development, if it is done in an appropriate way.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

We present a real options-based method with continuous scaling, and we find that there is a unique price limit for initiating the project. If the current electricity price is below this limit it is never optimal to invest, but above this limit investment is made according to the function for optimal size. The connection between the real option and the physical properties of a small hydropower plant is dealt with using a spreadsheet model that performs a technical simulation of the production in a plant, based on all the important choices for such a plant. The main results of the spreadsheet are simulated production size and the investment costs, which are in turn used for finding the value of the real option and the price limit. The method is illustrated on three different Norwegian small hydropower projects.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

The aim of this paper is to explore the roles of financial support, policy certainty and planning constraints in the diffusion of wind electricity in Denmark and the reasons prompting the change of the system in the current decade. It is discovered that political uncertainty has badly affected the effectiveness of the feed-in law in the years immediately after its introduction. With regard to the new system, it is concluded that the change has been prompted by generous conditions under the feed-in law and by the desire to facilitate the modernisation of old turbines. It is also concluded that incentive-based systems can be more effective than tradable quotas in promoting the modernisation of renewable plants. This finding is relevant to the development of energy policy in countries such as Germany and Spain, where the average age of wind turbines is much younger than those existing in Denmark.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

The key reason to use duration analysis methods is to allow for the possibility of duration dependence in one's data. However, while assumptions about the form of duration dependence appear to be purely methodological, duration dependence can have important substantive implications for theories of politics. There is often an interaction in estimation between duration dependence and covariates. In particular, duration dependence can be revealed or eliminated when particular time-varying variables are included in or removed from a model. This point is especially important because time-varying covariates are more central and common to important research questions than is sometimes realized. Overall, these points lead to the conclusion that findings about duration dependence go hand-in-hand with proper specification and that model specification both in terms of functional form and included variables must be carefully considered before duration methods are applied.},

As a result, little is known about the extent to which network externalities may influence network adoption and diffusion. Using electronic banking as a context and an econometric technique called hazard modeling, this research examines empirically the impact of network externalities and other influences that combine to determine network membership. The results support the network externalities hypothesis. We find that banks in markets that can generate a larger effective network size and a higher level of externalities tend to adopt early, while the size of a bank's own branch network (a proxy for the opportunity cost of adoption)decreases the probability of early adoption.},

The two driving factors are the elasticity of electricity supply from renewable energy sources relative to nonrenewable ones and the effective stringency of the target. The availability of other baseload generation helps to determine that stringency, and demand elasticity influences only the magnitude of the price effects, not the direction of those effects. The paper also evaluates circumstances under which higher standards can decrease both certificate prices and renewable energy supply. Sensitivity analysis indicates that assumptions about renewable energy supply slopes are more important than those about nonrenewable supplies in predicting the retail price impacts of renewable portfolio standards.},

	abstract = {Several US states have passed renewable portfolio standard (RPS) policies in order to encourage investment in renewable energy technologies. Existing research on their effectiveness has either employed a cross-sectional approach or has ignored heterogeneity among RPS policies. In this paper, we introduce a new measure for the stringency of an RPS that explicitly accounts for some RPS design features that may have a significant impact on the strength of an RPS. We also investigate the impacts of renewable portfolio standards on in-state renewable electricity development using panel data and our new measure of RPS stringency, and compare the results with those when alternative measures are used. Using our new measure, the results suggest that RPS policies have had a significant and positive effect on in-state renewable energy development, a finding which is masked when design differences among RPS policies are ignored. We also find that another important design feature – allowing “free trade” of REC’s – can significantly weaken the impact of an RPS. These results should prove instructive to policy makers, whether considering the development of a federal-level RPS or the development or redesign of a state-level RPS.},

The emphasis of the paper is on econometric and forecasting issues, and it discusses alternative methods of estimating Hubbert's model. Using data on oil production in the U.S. lower 48 states, the paper reports the results of estimating the various specifications of the model and its extensions by the maximum-likelihood method, and provides the implied estimates for ultimate resource recovery and their associated standard errors. When economic factors are taken into account the estimates of ultimate resource recovery become state-dependent, and we find that in this case the estimates are higher than those obtained from the various specifications of Hubbert's original model. Although the accuracy of the estimates of ultimate recoverable reserves cannot be evaluated before oil reserves are actually exhausted, we examine how the various models estimated over the periods 1926–1985 and 1948–1985 perform in predicting oil production over the 1986–1990 period.},

The model also indicates how exploration uncertainty affects the competitive firm's extraction and exploration decisions.

This paper concerns crude oil reserve appreciation in both the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. It examines the change in reserves attributed to North Sea fields over time, seeking to reveal patterns of reserve appreciation both for individual fields and for groups of fields classified by potentially relevant common elements. These include field size, year of production start-up, geological age, gravity, depth and depletion rate. The paper emphasizes the statistical analysis of reserve appreciation. It contrasts the Norwegian and UK experience. An important distinction is drawn between appreciation of oil-in-place and changes in recovery factors. North Sea oil reserve appreciation between production start-up and the last observation year (usually 1996) is found to be substantial, but generally lacks a consistent profile. Appreciation recorded for the Norwegian fields on average is considerably greater than for the UK. Most UK appreciation is seemingly accounted for by oil-in-place; in Norway, from increases in recovery factors. However, UK recovery factors commence at much higher levels than those for Norway.},

Concern about the effect of this dependence on economic and national security has focused attention on the domestic resource base: how much oil awaits discovery and at what rate can it be produced? We analyze the adequacy of domestic resources by updating and modifying in important new ways the models of discovery and production developed by M. King Hubbert. HubberVs models have been a lightning rod for debate about the future of oil resources because they have been the most accurate on record. When we include real oil prices and the annual rate of drilling effort in Hubbert's model of oil discovery, there is no evidence for claims that the secular decline in discoveries per foot of well drilled has been arrested or reversed in the lower forty-eight states. Our results indicate that there is little oil waiting to be found in unexplored sedimentary formations in the lower forty-eight states using conventional exploration techniques. Furthermore, we show that the declining quality of the resource base has offset the positive stimuli of price increases and changes in government policy towards a free market. Having passed through a period in which production in the lower forty-eight states fell 20 percent while real oil prices tripled, there seems little that the U.S. government can do to alter the bottom line for domestic operators so that U.S. production can displace imports to a significant degree. We conclude that the conventional supply side offers little room to manoeuvre around increased dependence on imported oil.},

On windy days, Denmark tends to export electricity to its neighbours, and to import power on calm days. Storing electricity in this way thus allows the country to deal with the intermittency of wind generation. We show that this kind of behaviour is theoretically optimal when a region with wind and thermal generation can trade with one based on hydro power. However, annual trends in Denmark's trade follow its output of thermal generation and are inversely related to Nordic production of hydro power and the amount of water available to Scandinavian generators, with no correlation with wind generation. We estimate the cost of volatility in Denmark's wind output to equal between 4\% and 8\% of its market value.},

	abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

Attempts to widen the circle of relationships by borrowing from multiple lenders increases the price and reduces the availability of credit.

We do not find empirical support for the signaling models that try to explain why firms underprice. In fact, we find that (1) firms that underprice more return to the reissue market less frequently, and for lesser amounts, than firms that underprice less, and (2) firms that underprice less experience higher earnings and pay higher dividends, contrary to the models’ predictions.},

It is shown in general that reputations, because they can reward high quality production only with a lag, can work only imperfectly. Viewing reputation as an expectation of quality, this article studies the properties of quality expectations that are fulfilled. When sellers set quality once and for all, any self-fulfilling quality level must lie below the perfect information quality level. The same is true of steady-state quality levels when sellers can vary quality over time. Finally, the relationship between consumer information and product quality is explored.},

Most national governments have instituted nonmarket regulatory mechanisms for banking firms, on the grounds that market-based mechanisms do not adequately discipline banks. But what evidence supports this assessment? Why must governments assure bank solvency, but not the solvency of other firms? Government oversight naturally displaces private efforts to evaluate and control financial firms. Moreover, if the banking business changes over time-as it assuredly has in the past decade or two-the best combination of government and private supervision may change concurrently. This paper reviews and evaluates the growing empirical literature on private investors' abilities to assess the financial condition of banking firms. The evidence supports the proposition that market investors and analysts could reasonably provide a greater proportion of corporate governance services for large, traded U.S. financial firms.},

We observe multiple price/quality combinations in equilibrium, which depend upon the distribution of information costs of consumers and upon whether quality, or price, or both are costly observable. Welfare comparisons of equilibrium are considered. We show that welfare will be greater when price advertising is permitted.},

The literature reveals that costs are coming down, but with large uncertainties on past, current and future costs of the dominating Li-ion technology. This paper presents an original systematic review, analysing over 80 different estimates reported 2007–2014 to systematically trace the costs of Li-ion battery packs for BEV manufacturers. We show that industry-wide cost estimates declined by approximately 14\% annually between 2007 and 2014, from above US\$1,000 per kWh to around US\$410 per kWh, and that the cost of battery packs used by market-leading BEV manufacturers are even lower, at US\$300 per kWh, and has declined by 8\% annually. Learning rate, the cost reduction following a cumulative doubling of production, is found to be between 6 and 9\%, in line with earlier studies on vehicle battery technology. We reveal that the costs of Li-ion battery packs continue to decline and that the costs among market leaders are much lower than previously reported. This has significant implications for the assumptions used when modelling future energy and transport systems and permits an optimistic outlook for BEVs contributing to low-carbon transport.},

	abstract = {Cap-and-trade, a regulatory instrument widely used to constrain greenhouse gas and other pollution, has recently been criticized for producing only small amounts of intended emission reductions. This paper looks at the empirical record of cap-and-trade since the beginning in 1995, and shows that emission targets have almost always been easier and cheaper to reach than expected. The five main reasons are generous targets, changes in economic output, fuel price movements, innovation, and complementary emission reduction policies. Overall, this failure to predict mitigation potentials may relate to a psychological “end of history bias,” whereby policymakers, industry, and analysts think that less change will happen in the future than has demonstrably happened in the past. Consequently, more abatement is possible and at lower costs than generally thought, rendering the prices of emission permits hard to predict. For climate research, the findings imply that emission scenarios assuming ever-increasing pollution prices may benefit from integrating recent experience with cap-and-trade regulations. In policy terms, mechanisms such as floor prices need to be considered to guarantee emission reductions under uncertainty.},

Based on panel data of 214 licenses to construct small run-of-the-river hydropower plants, we examine whether the prospect of a common Swedish–Norwegian market for green certificates (i.e., a renewable portfolio standard scheme) affected the timing of investments. Our results show that traditional utilities and other professional investors in the energy market acted in accordance with a real options investment rule, and the prospect of possible future subsidies delayed their investment decision. On the other hand, our results do not show that farmers and other non-professional investors incorporated timing considerations in their investment decisions. Rather, our results indicate that these investors behaved as if their investment opportunity is now-or-never, investing if the project is profitable according to a net present value investment rule, ignoring the opportunity to create additional value by waiting. The observed difference in behavior between professional and non-professional investors is interesting given the distributed nature of many renewable energy technologies, and can help planners and policymakers better understand the forces shaping the future market for electricity.},

Majd and Pindyck (1987) published a noteworthy con- tribution that is highly relevant to our study. They demonstrate that uncertainty should have a depressive effect on investment spending in a sequential investment process with time-to-build. 






Quigg (1993) finds empirical support for a model where market prices reflect a premium for the option to wait to invest in land development. 
 



Moel and Tufano (2002) find that mine closures are influenced by the volatility and price of gold and that the real option model is a good descriptor of how flexibility is handled by mining compa- nies. Bulan (2005) shows empirically that both increased industry and firm-specific uncertainty have a depressing effect on investments in the U.S. manufacturing sec- tor. Dunne and Mu (2010) empirically model the investment process of U.S. oil refineries and show that increased uncertainty decreases the likelihood of refineies modifying their capacity 
 



Kellogg (2010) studies the Texas onshore oil drilling industry and finds that drilling activity responds to changes in oil price volatility with a magnitude that is consistent with real op- tion theory. Slade (2013) finds evidence for the effect described by Bar-Ilan and Strange (1996, 1998) regarding how investment lags affect investment spending. 
 



Copper mines fit well into Bar-Ilan and Strange (1996)’s model as there are substantial investment lags and considerable copper price uncertainty. She finds that greater uncertainty encourages investment and lowers the price threshold when there is longer time to build. 
 



Authors that have investigated real option effects of regulatory uncertainty in electricity generation include, among others, Ishii and Yan (2011) and Fleten et al. (2012) . 



 






Fleten et al. (2012) examine empirically the option to abandon, startup and shutdown existing power plants in the U.S. between 2001 and 2009. They find that regulatory uncertainty decreases the probability of shutting down operating plants and decreases the probability of starting up shutdown plants. These findings lend strong support to real option theory as higher uncertainty should decrease the probability of early exercise. 
 



Our analysis assesses proposed combined cycle turbines fueled by natural gas (CCGTs) and proposed gas fueled combustion turbines (GTs). 
 



The heat rate data is gathered from EPA’s continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) data. CEMS only contains data for the whole combined cycle turbine, not for the individual steam or combustion part, which makes it necessary to merge the two parts. We have merged the capacity of the steam turbine part and the combustion turbine part of the same generator found in Form 860 and named them CCs (Combine Cycle Turbines) in our final dataset. This is done in order to correctly merge the EIA data together with the data used to calculate heat rates for each generator.11

	abstract = {This article investigates the regulatory regimes for offshore oil and gas in the United States (U.S.), United Kingdom (U.K.), and Norway from both a positive and normative perspective. The positive analysis reveals that all three countries are converging on a similar regulatory system that combines strict liability, command-and-control, and management-based regulations for controlling site-specific risks. The timing of the adoption of each element in this regulatory system varies across the three countries and has been driven largely by accidents along the individual country’s continental shelf. In particular, the adoption of the management-based approach occurred after a significant accident revealed the weaknesses of a one-size-fits–all set of prescriptive rules. Although the normative analysis reveals theoretical support for the use of both liability and management-based approaches, the empirical data are limited, and the data that do exist call into question the superiority of the management-based approach over command-and-control. More research is needed that develops and systematically evaluates incentive-compatible regulatory regimes. (JEL: Q38, Q40, Q48, K32)},

	abstract = {We develop a microeconomic model of endogenous growth where clean and dirty technologies compete in production and innovation—in the sense that research can be directed to either clean or dirty technologies. If dirty technologies are more advanced to start with, the potential transition to clean technology can be difficult both because clean research must climb several rungs to catch up with dirty technology and because this gap discourages research effort directed towards clean technologies. Carbon taxes and research subsidies may nonetheless encourage production and innovation in clean technologies, though the transition will typically be slow. We characterize certain general properties of the transition path from dirty to clean technology. We then estimate the model using a combination of regression analysis on the relationship between R\&D and patents, and simulated method of moments using microdata on employment, production, R\&D, firm growth, entry and exit from the US energy sector. The model's quantitative implications match a range of moments not targeted in the estimation quite well. We then characterize the optimal policy path implied by the model and our estimates. Optimal policy makes heavy use of research subsidies as well as carbon taxes. We use the model to evaluate the welfare consequences of a range of alternative policies.},

firms to reap larger tax credits. I find the prices firms report for third party systems exceed
prices of customer owned systems by 8\%, or \$3,000 per system. My findings imply that third
party PV firms in California were awarded \$20 million in excess ITC tax benefits due to price
over-reporting between 2007 and 2011. I estimate the incidence of the subsidy using a change
in ITC benefits due to a cap-lift in 2009, which increased the mean award by \$10,000. I find
that 83\% of ITC benefits accrue to firms, with only a small portion realized by consumers.},

Thus, the price effect on the day ahead-market was small and short-lived as concluded by the European Commision (2011). Looking at cross-border electricity trade flows, the immediate impact of the moratorium is obvious for the period surrounding the commencement. According to the report of the Bundesnetzagentur (2011), Germany turned from being a net-exporter of 4.1 GW to an net-importer of 1 GW, effectively compensating for the nuclear capacities by imports from the neighboring European countries. 
 



 However, due to the large variation of spot prices, it is not possible to rule out an effect of the nuclear moratorium. Generally, the influence on the day-ahead market was less distinct because the suspended capacity was comparable to the normal fluctuations of renewable electricity production, which had a high availability during the time of the announcement of the moratorium. 
 



The electricity futures traded at the EEX reacted with a steep price increase, which is shown in Figure 4. Given an instant daily price increase of roughly 15\%, the mere existence of a moratorium effect is obvious for the electricity futures. However, also the gas and carbon futures prices rose, probably because the market expected an increasing demand for fossil fuels, which are used to offset the suspended nuclear capacities. As a consequence, the event study focuses on analyzing the impact of the different influences that cause the electricity prices to rise. The method proposed in this study allows to determine whether the market efficiently accounts for the new information. 









In theory, there are two separate shifts of the merit order for the according electricity futures with delivery between March 2011 and June 2011. First, the supply curve is shifted left by about 6 GW, because nuclear generation capacity with low marginal costs is removed from the system. This effect is called the capacity effect of the moratorium. Second, the increased gas and carbon futures prices result in an upwards shift of the merit order.

10 Q report




We integrate the sales, engineering, installation, monitoring, maintenance and financing of our distributed solar energy systems. This allows us to offer long-term energy solutions to residential, commercial and government customers. Our customers buy renewable energy from us for less than they currently pay for electricity from utilities with little to no up-front cost. Our long-term contractual arrangements typically generate recurring customer payments and enable our customers to have insight into their future electricity costs and to minimize their exposure to rising retail electricity rates. Our customer relationships also enable us to continue to offer our customers complimentary products and service offerings including energy storage solutions. 
 




We offer our customers the option to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce through various contractual arrangements. These contractual arrangements include long-term leases and power purchase agreements. In both structures, we install our solar energy system at our customer’s premises and charge the customer a monthly fee for the power that our system produces. In the lease structure, this monthly payment is fixed with a production guarantee. In the power purchase agreement structure, we charge customers a fee per kWh based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces. The leases and power purchase agreements are typically for 20 years, and generally when there is no upfront prepayment the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations. 




 








We compete mainly with the retail electricity rate charged by the utilities in the markets we serve, and our strategy is to price the energy we sell below that rate. As a result, the price our customers pay to buy energy from us varies depending on the state where the customer is located and the local utility. The price we charge also depends on customer price sensitivity, the need to offer a compelling financial benefit and the price other solar energy companies charge in the region. Our commercial rates in a given region are also typically lower than our residential rates in that region because utilities’ commercial retail rates are generally lower than their residential retail rates. 
 




We generally recognize revenue from solar energy systems sold to our customers when we install the solar energy system and it passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. We account for our leases and power purchase agreements as operating leases. We recognize the revenue these arrangements generate on a straight-line basis over the term for leases, and as we generate and deliver energy for power purchase agreements. We recognize revenue from our energy efficiency business when one of our partners completes the services for the referred customer. Substantially all of our revenue is attributable to customers located in the United States. 
 




We monetize certain government incentives in the form of investment tax credits, or ITCs, under lease pass-through structures by assigning the ITCs to investors in exchange for upfront cash payments. We record the amounts we receive from the investors for the ITCs as a liability, which is subsequently recognized as revenue as the five-year recapture period expires. 




 








In addition to nominal contracted payments, our leases and power purchase agreements provide us with a significant post-contract renewal opportunity. Because our solar energy systems have an estimated life of 30 years, they will continue to have a useful life after the 20- year term of their leases or power purchase agreements. At the end of an original contract term, we intend to offer our customer a renewal contract. The solar energy system will already be installed on the customer’s building, which will facilitate the customer’s acceptance of our renewal offer and will result in limited additional costs to us. 
 




Reductions in, or eliminations or expirations of, governmental incentives could adversely impact our results of operations and ability to compete in our industry by increasing our cost of capital, causing us to increase the prices of our energy and solar energy systems, and reducing the size of our addressable market. In addition, this would adversely impact our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds and our ability to offer attractive financing to prospective customers. For the quarter ended June 30, 2014, approximately 99.2\% of new customers chose to enter into financed lease or power purchase agreements rather than buying a solar energy system for cash. 
 




Our leases and power purchase agreements are third-party ownership arrangements. Sales of electricity by third parties face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. Other challenges pertain to whether third-party owned systems qualify for the same levels of rebates or other non-tax incentives available for customer-owned solar energy systems, whether third-party owned systems are eligible at all for these incentives, and whether third-party owned systems are eligible for net metering and the associated significant cost savings. Reductions in, or eliminations of, this treatment of these third-party arrangements could reduce demand for our systems, adversely impact our access to capital and could cause us to increase the price we charge our customers for energy. 




 








If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department makes additional determinations that the fair market value of our solar energy systems is materially lower than what we have claimed, we may have to pay significant amounts to our financing funds or to our fund investors and such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. 
 




In July 2012, we and other companies that are significant participants in both the solar industry and the cash grant program under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of the Inspector General to deliver certain documents in our respective possession. In particular, our subpoena requested, among other things, documents dated, created, revised or referred to since January 1, 2007 that relate to our applications for U.S. Treasury grants or communications with certain other solar development companies or certain firms that appraise solar energy property for U.S. Treasury grant application purposes. The Inspector General is working with the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the administration and implementation of the U.S. Treasury grant program, including possible misrepresentations concerning the fair market value of the solar power systems submitted for grant under that program made in grant applications by companies in the solar industry, including us. We intend to cooperate fully with the Inspector General and the Department of Justice. We are continuing to produce documents and testimony as requested by the Inspector General and we anticipate at least three months will be required to complete the gathering and production of such information, and that the Inspector General will require at least another six to nine months to conclude its review. If at the conclusion of the investigation the Inspector General concludes that misrepresentations were made, the Department of Justice could decide to bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us. If it were successful in asserting this action, we could then be required to pay damages and penalties for any funds received based on such misrepresentations (which, in turn, could require us to make indemnity payments to certain of our fund investors). Such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, the period of time necessary to resolve the investigation is uncertain, and this matter could require significant management and financial resources that could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business. 
 




We and our fund investors claim the Federal ITC or the U.S. Treasury grant in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar energy systems. We have obtained independent appraisals to support the fair market values we report for claiming Federal ITCs and U.S. Treasury grants. The Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department review these fair market values. With respect to U.S. Treasury grants, the U.S. Treasury Department reviews the reported fair market value in determining the amount initially awarded, and the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department may also subsequently audit the fair market value and determine that amounts previously awarded must be repaid to the U.S. Treasury Department or that excess awards constitute taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such audits of a small number of our financing funds are ongoing. With respect to Federal ITCs, the Internal Revenue Service may review the fair market value on audit and determine that the tax credits previously claimed must be reduced. If the fair market value is determined in these circumstances to be less than we reported, we may owe our financing fund or our fund investors an amount equal to this difference, plus any costs and expenses associated with a challenge to that valuation. We could also be subject to tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. 




 








We have historically benefited from the declining cost of solar panels, and our business and financial results may be harmed as a result of increases in the cost of solar panels or tariffs on imported solar panels imposed by the U.S. government. 
 




The U.S. government has imposed tariffs on solar cells manufactured in China. Based on determinations by the U.S. government, the most recent applicable anti-dumping and countervailing tariff rates range from approximately 33\%-255\%. Such anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs are subject to annual review and may be increased. These tariffs have increased the price of solar panels containing Chinese-manufactured solar cells. In the past, we purchased a significant portion of the solar panels used in our solar energy systems from manufacturers based in China. Currently, many of the solar panels we purchase contain components from China or Taiwan. The purchase price of solar panels containing solar cells manufactured in China reflects these tariff penalties. While solar panels containing solar cells manufactured outside of China are not subject to these tariffs, the prices of these solar panels are, and may continue to be, more expensive than panels produced using Chinese solar cells, before giving effect to the tariff penalties. 
 




In addition, the U.S. government has new trade investigations relating to certain components exported from China and Taiwan. In early June 2014, the U.S. government announced its affirmative preliminary determination in the countervailing duty case and in July 2014, the government announced affirmative preliminary determinations in the antidumping cases against both China and Taiwan. As a result, cash deposits are now required from importers of record based on these preliminary rates and pricing of affected solar photovoltaic panel components has increased. The new preliminary tariffs do not apply to modules with Chinese solar cells. Those modules are still covered by the existing tariffs from the first trade case. Final determinations in the new trade case are expected before the end of the year. 




 








Under current law, the Federal ITC will be reduced from approximately 30\% of the cost of the solar energy systems to approximately 10\% for solar energy systems placed in service after December 31, 2016. In addition, U.S. Treasury grants are no longer available for new solar energy systems. Moreover, potential fund investors must remain satisfied that the structures we offer make the tax benefits associated with solar energy systems available to these investors, which depends both on the investors’ assessment of the tax law and the absence of any unfavorable interpretations of that law. Changes in existing law and interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts could reduce the willingness of fund investors to invest in funds associated with these solar energy system investments. We cannot assure you that this type of financing will be available to us. If, for any reason, we are unable to finance solar energy systems through tax-advantaged structures or if we are unable to realize or monetize depreciation benefits, we may no longer be able to provide solar energy systems to new customers on an economically viable basis. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We find that: (1) solar costs have declined substantially over time; (2) policy incentives have impacted pre-rebate installed costs, and some cost inflation is apparent; (3) economies of scale have driven down costs for larger systems; (4) systems installed in new home developments and in affordable housing projects have experienced much lower costs than the general retrofit market; and (5) installer experience and type, module type, and system location have all affected costs, but the effects differ by program. Results hold important implications for solar suppliers and customers, and for policymakers designing incentive programs. 1. INTRODUCTION The promise of electricity generated from photovoltaics (PV) is alluring: PV is renewable, clean, distributed, and fuel-free. As a result, markets for customer-sited, grid- connected PV systems are expanding rapidly, albeit from a small base. Government incentives aimed at encouraging reductions in the cost of PV over time are the principal drivers for this growth, and substantial cost reductions will be needed if PV is to become more than a niche technology. This article, which is based on a longer report from Berkeley Lab (Wiser et al. 2006), summarizes an in-depth statistical analysis of PV system costs in California. Through mid-November 2005, a total of 130 MW AC of grid- connected PV capacity was installed throughout California, making that state the dominant market for PV in the U.S., though still far behind Germany and Japan on a worldwide basis. California’s market is poised for dramatic new growth, as the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) announced in January 2006 that the CPUC and the California Energy Commission (CEC) would dedicate roughly \$3.2 billion over 11-years for customer-sited solar installations. This California Solar Initiative has the stated goal of increasing the amount of rooftop solar units to 3,000 MW by 2017, making it the most ambitious publicly-funded PV deployment program in the country. The results presented here are based on an analysis of 18,942 grid-connected PV systems totaling 254 MW AC , 1 either installed, approved for installation, or waitlisted (approved but awaiting program funding) under what are currently the two largest PV programs in the state. The data used for this analysis represent what is likely the most comprehensive source of actual PV installed cost information available worldwide. Data on PV capacity and costs are expressed throughout this article in W AC , which we convert (where necessary) from W DC-STC (DC Watts at standard test conditions) using a de-rate factor of 0.84. Many other solar programs use W DC-STC , making comparisons of California data with those in other states and countries more difficult.},

	abstract = {The extent and timing of cost-reducing improvements in low-carbon energy systems are important sources of uncertainty in future levels of greenhouse-gas emissions. Models that assess the costs of climate change mitigation policy, and energy policy in general, rely heavily on learning curves to include technology dynamics. Historically, no energy technology has changed more dramatically than photovoltaics (PV), the cost of which has declined by a factor of nearly 100 since the 1950s. Which changes were most important in accounting for the cost reductions that have occurred over the past three decades? Are these results consistent with the notion that learning from experience drove technical change? In this paper, empirical data are assembled to populate a simple model identifying the most important factors affecting the cost of PV. The results indicate that learning from experience, the theoretical mechanism used to explain learning curves, only weakly explains change in the most important factors—plant size, module efficiency, and the cost of silicon. Ways in which the consideration of a broader set of influences, such as technical barriers, industry structure, and characteristics of demand, might be used to inform energy technology policy are discussed.},

European Economic Review


This study uses a large sample of homes in the San Diego area and Sacramento, California area to provide some of the first capitalization estimates of the sales value of homes with solar panels relative to comparable homes without solar panels. Although the residential solar home market continues to grow, there is little direct evidence on the market capitalization effect. Using both hedonics and a repeat sales index approach we find that solar panels are capitalized at roughly a 3.5\% premium. This premium is larger in communities with a greater share of college graduates and of registered Prius hybrid vehicles. 


 



In this paper, we examine two aspects of solar purchases. We provide new hedonic marginal valuation estimates for a large sample of solar homes based on recent real estate transactions in San Diego County and Sacramento County. We document evidence of a solar price premium and find that this premium is larger in environmentalist communities. In most mature housing markets, we expect that the econometrician knows less about the market than the decision makers. In the case of solar panels, our interactions with professionals in the field suggests that these professionals have little basis for estimating the pecuniary benefits of solar installation. Our second empirical contribution is to document what types of people, in terms of education, political ideology and demographic attributes do and do not live in solar homes. Most hedonic studies that use sales data (rather than Census data) know very little about the household who actually lives in the home, but we can observe household characteristics for a single year. 
 



A distinctive feature of solar panels is that on a day to day basis they have no ‘‘use value’’ as compared to a new bathroom or kitchen. 
 



For those households who derive pleasure from knowing that they are generating their own electricity, the solar panels will yield ‘‘existence value’’. Such households will recognize that they have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions and thus are providing world public goods. 



-Incentive programs cover almost all installation in San Diego County



We find that households in which all voters are registered liberal and in which the household contributes to environmental organizations are much more likely to be in solar homes controlling for education, imputed income, the age of the oldest registered household member, and whether any children are present in the household









This study used a large sample of homes in the San Diego and Sacramento areas to provide some of the first capitalization estimates of the resale value of homes with solar panels relative to comparable homes without solar panels. Although the residential solar home market continues to grow, there is little direct evidence on the market capitalization effect. Using both hedonics and a repeat sales index approach we find that solar panels are capitalized at roughly a 3\% to 4\% premium. This premium is larger in communities with more registered Prius hybrid vehicles and in communities featuring a larger share of college graduates. 
Our new marginal valuation estimates inform the debate led by Borenstein (2008) on whether expenditure on residential solar is a ‘‘good investment.’’ His analysis evaluates residential solar installations solely as a ‘pure’ investment good judged in terms of upfront cost and subsequent power generation. Our evidence suggests that similar to other home investments such as a new kitchen, solar installation bundles both investment value and consumption value. Some households may take pride in knowing that they are producers of ‘‘green’’ electricity and ‘‘warm glow’’ may triumph over present discounted value calculations in determining a household’s install choice.

Over the last 10 years, the solar photovoltaic (PV) market has experienced tremendous growth due in part to government incentive programs. This paper esti- mates a dynamic model to understand the impact of these programs on residential solar installations and evaluate the impact of alternative incentive policies. The model evaluates the effect of system costs, capacity-based subsidies, tax credits and production revenues using a 51/4 year data set collected by the California Solar Initiative program, which subsidized solar installations in California. The results indicate that capacity-based subsidies are equally effective as production-based sub- sidies, but that the latter is more efficient. With a \$120 social cost of carbon, the total subsidies in California would be welfare neutral. If California were only as sunny as Frankfurt, Germany and to maintain the current amount of solar electric- ity production, this value would have to be \$730 to be welfare neutral. We find that the subsidies contribute around 40\% to 60\% of the installations. The declining schedule of the subsidy design does encourage more adoptions earlier on; however, the flat rate subsidy would have encouraged more adoptions overall when the price of the solar power systems is lower. 
 



Hughes and Podolefsky (2013) studies the effect of the subsidy in California on the adoption rate. 
 



This observation shows that the price of solar modules doesn’t depend on the domestic activity to a large extend and avoids the potential endogeneity concern. 
 



In1998,Californiawasoneofthefirststates to provide a capacity-based solar incentive policy following the electricity deregulation. The funding for these programs is supported by the Public Benefit Fund. It is collected by each investor-owned utility (IOU) company based on the ratepayer’s electricity usage21 through a ”public good charge”, created by AB1890 in 1996. There were two parallel subsidy programs that were in effect from 1998 to December 31, 2006. California Energy Commission’s (CEC) Emerging Renewable Program (ERP) which targets residential and small commercial solar systems that are under 30 kW. Larger commercial systems are funded through California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) self-generation incetive program (SGIP). There were very few adoptions in the market despite the initial \$3/W subsidy22 and the preexisting net-metering rule. Cumulative installation increased by a mere 43\% from 6 MW in 1996 level to 8.7 MW at the end of 1999. 



Systems larger than 30 kW24 are required to take the 5-year performance-based incentive to receive monthly payments while smaller systems are to take the expected performance-based buydown (EPBB) subsidy and receive a one-time lumpsum upfront payment.25 This upfront capacity- based rebate starts at \$2.50/W and declines to nil following a block schedule as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7.  When the aggregate installed capacity reached a preset amount, the subsidy level moves down to the next level. 
 



While the CSI subsidy level varies at the utility level (and time), the federal tax credit has only one major policy change in 2009 and the system cost varies at the county/city level. The only variable that has variation at the zip code level is solar irradiation, which measures the average solar energy received per square meter per day. Solar irradiation ranges from the low 5.08 kWh/m2/day in Sebastopol, Sonoma county to the highest 6.57 kWh/m2/day in Essex, San Bernadino, with a mean of 5.55. Data on solar irradiation comes from NREL PVWatts v.2 based on 40 km2 grid cells. 






 -What is the change in federal tax in 2009?
 



The first two components are observed- the monthly solar module index price is from SolarBuzz and the labor cost data is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 






During the sample period, the federal residential renewable energy tax credit remains constant at the 30\% level. The change came in when the American Recovery and Rein- vestment Act of 2009 removed the maximum credit cap of \$2000 and allowed households to claim the full 30\% credit which was around \$10,000 for a 5.39 kW system in 2012. This is a significant change from an effective 5\% of tax credit in 2008 to the 30\% credit in 2009. Other than this change, there is a perfect correlation between the tax credit and the upfront system cost by design. 












In 2012, the number of households investing in the larger size systems exceedd the number of house- holds investing in the smaller systems. This phenomenon can perhaps be explained by the observation that over 70\% of adopters chose a solar leasing program in 2012. That is, by removing the financing constraint, people chose to install an optimal size which is larger than 5 kW.

The high cost of power from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels has been a major deterrent to the technology’s market penetration. Proponents have argued, however, that typical analyses overlook many of the benefits of solar PV. Some of those benefits are in the realm of environmental and security externalities, but others occur within the electricity markets. In this paper, I attempt to do a more complete market valuation of solar PV. I incorporate the fact that power from solar PV panels is generated disproportionately at times when electricity is most valuable due to high demand and increased line losses. I find that the degree to which the timing of solar PV production enhances its value depends very much on the extent to which wholesale prices peak with demand, which in turn depends on the proportion of reserve capacity held in the system.

Solar PV is also argued to have enhanced value within an electrical grid, because the power is produced at the location of the end-user and therefore can reduce the costs of transmission and distribution investments. My analysis, however, suggests that actual installation of solar PV systems in California has not significantly reduced the cost of transmission and distribution infrastructure, and is unlikely to do so in other regions. I then bring together these adjustments to the valuation of solar PV power with calculations of its cost to analyze the market value of solar PV. The market benefits of installing the current solar PV technology, even after adjusting for its timing and transmission advantages, are calculated to be much smaller than the costs. The difference is so large that including current plausible estimates of the value of reducing greenhouse gases still does not come close to making the net social return on installing solar PV today positive. 
 




Proponents of solar PV panels argue, however, that standard analyses fail to capture the enhanced value of solar PV power that results from its temporal and locational char- acteristics. Solar power is generated during daylight hours and on average generated in greater quantity when the sun is shining more intensely. As a result, in summer-peaking electricity systems, such as California and most of the U.S., power from PVs is produced disproportionately at times when the value of electricity is high. Electricity value is higher when system demand is high both because the wholesale price of electricity in the grid is greater and because the proportion of power lost through heat dissipation during electricity transmission and distribution increases with the total amount of power flowing over the lines. Because PV power is generated on-site, such losses are avoided. 
On-site generation is argued to deliver another economic advantage that is often over- looked in cost analyses. Power from central station generation requires significant invest- ment in transmission and distribution infrastructure, investment that could potentially be reduced if more power were generated on site. Thus, a valuation of solar PV electricity production that compares it to the average cost of generating electricity, and also ignores the potential savings in transmission and distribution infrastructure, will tend to under- value the power from PV. Few would dispute this view, at least for transmission, but the magnitudes of these effects have not been systematically quantified. 








The results suggest that the value of power delivered from solar PV panels is substantially greater than would result from simply valuing solar PV power at the average power cost, regardless of when it is produced. 
The use of leasing-models, as discussed in this paper, are evidence of the dramatically changed economics of solar power over the last several years.
 




Solar PV production not only peaks in the middle of the day, when demand peaks, it does so disproportionately to demand.
 




Figure 1 also demonstrates that by turning the solar panels more towards the west, peak production from the solar panels can be more closely synchronized with system demand, but at a cost of lower overall production levels. 
 




California, about 7\% of generated electricity is lost this way, but the number is greater at peak times, so there is synergy between the locational and timing advantages of solar PV. 
 




The argument, however, is made more frequently and forcefully in the context of wind power than solar power, because spatially distributed solar PV resources are not likely to have a high second-to-second correlation in output, so threats to grid stability are generally of less concern, at least at current levels of solar PV penetration. 
 
 




The bottom row of each case demonstrates clearly that a market organization that finances capacity costs through payments that do not vary with the scarcity value of energy greatly reduces the market valuation of solar PV. Much of the valuation boost that solar PV gets from a real-time pricing valuation evaporates if those real-time prices are never permitted to rise above the marginal cost of the highest cost generation. Instead of the 30\%-50\% increase from time varying valuation of the power that comes out of PsimL and PsimH, the premium is only 10\%-20\% when prices are constrained at marginal cost of the last unit produced.20 




 








After installation, the largest cost that the owner of a solar PV system is expected to face is for replacing the inverter. Median time-to-failure estimates for inverters range from 5-10 years, so I assume 8 years, which implies that the inverter will have to be replaced twice over the 25-year life of the panels, assumed to occur in years 8 and 16. Current inverter cost for a 10kW system is in the range of \$8000, but that is likely to decline over time. Inverter costs are assumed to decline by 2\% per year in real terms, consistent with a study by Navigant consulting (2006) for National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

January 2006, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) established the California Solar Initiative (CSI), a \$3.3-billion, 10-year rebate program aiming to “install 3,000 megawatts (MW) of new solar over the next decade and to transform the mar- ket for solar energy by reducing the cost of solar” 
 




We leverage the fact that in the solar PV market, the decision to install solar panels does not lead to an instantaneous instal- lation, as a result of the time needed to complete the necessary paperwork and perform the installation. 
 




In our situation, we would not expect social interactions to have an effect until the solar PV panels have actually been installed, after which point the adopter would have experienced the benefits of the panels and neigh- bors may then be able to see the installation.

We further augment the installation data with zip code-level demographic data from Source- book America and American FactFinder, as well as data on hybrid vehicle registrations from R. L. Polk \& Co. 








The presence of peer effects should also imply accel- erating adoption in regions with more installations. 












quadratic term, implying increasing effects of new installations. In another specifica- tion we interact the installed base and year. Fig- ure 5 plots these coefficients9 with robust standard errors, again indicating that the installed base effect increases over time. Such an increase may derive from recent marketing efforts to leverage peer effects to induce adoptions. For example, one of the strate- gies employed by SolarCity (the largest installer in California) involves finding one or two vocal solar advocates in a neighborhood and giving the entire neighborhood a slightly lower price if enough adop- tions are made within that neighborhood. 
















The interaction with median income is economi- cally significant: running the regression on only the lower half of the zip code income distribution leads to a coefficient and standard error of 2.478 (0.680); for the top half, it is 1.243 (0.454). So although households with lower income may be less likely to adopt solar, they are more influenced by the peer effect. This is consistent with the high percentage of consumers naming finances as a primary reason for adopting solar, especially if the financial benefits of adoption are learned through information exchange.12 
If peer effects are a major factor underlying the clus- tering pattern in the data, we might expect to see evi- dence of peer effects at a more localized level than the zip code. With 2001–2006 address-level data from the California Energy Commission Emerging Renewables Program, we can examine how solar PV system adop- tion decisions are affected by the previous decisions of others on the same street. We define a street here as a street within a zip code, so that a long street that is in several zip codes is considered several separate streets. We create a panel data set where an obser- vation is a street-month.18 Table 8 provides summary 
 




This paper provides a straightforward methodology for consistently estimating peer effects in the adop- tion of new technologies that display a lag between the time of adoption and delivery, and then it quan- tifies the magnitude of those peer effects. We find strong evidence for causal peer effects, indicating that an extra installation in a zip code increases the probability of an adoption in the zip code by 0.78 per- centage points when evaluated at the average num- ber of owner-occupied homes in a zip code. These peer effects appear to increase in magnitude over time and are greater for larger installations and at the more localized street level. Our findings also indicate that peer effects appear to lead to larger installations. The results are suggestive of the pathways by which peer effects work: both visibility of the panels and word of mouth appear to contribute to social interac- tions that lead to further adoption. Accordingly, both image motivation and information transfer are likely to underlie the peer effects. These findings have clear implications for marketers who are striving to reduce the high cost of consumer acquisition in the solar PV market.

We exploit variation in rebate rates across electric utilities over time and control for time-varying factors that affect PV adoption. 
 



Of the \$437 million in rebates awarded, \$98 million were rents to installations that would have taken place absent rebates. 
 



This paper is part of a small but growing literature to understand the impact of subsidies for solar PV. Bollinger and Gillingham (2012) explore the role of CSI rebates in their study of peer effects in PV adoption. They use 33 zip codes along the PG\&E and SCE boundary to show that higher CSI rebates are associated with higher adoption rates.4 In contrast to Bollinger and Gillingham (2012) who use indicator variables for rebate changes, we use the actual rebate levels to quantify the relationship between rebate rates and the number of adoptions. More recently, Burr (2012) explores consumer responses to different incentive designs in the context of the CSI. Using a dynamic structural model for consumer utility she finds that adoptions would be 85 percent lower in the absence of current CSI subsidies. She finds the CSI would be welfare neutral for a social cost of carbon of approximately \$100 per MT. Burr assumes that variation in rebate rates is exogenous, an assumption we explore in our work. 
 



These results are consistent with our finding that 42 percent of households which adopted PV under the CSI would have adopted without rebates. 



 Gallagher and Muehlegger (2011) study consumer responses to different types of incentives, and find that the type of incentive matters as much as its magnitude. They find the effect of sales tax waivers on adoption to be ten times that of income tax credits, in part due to their relative immediacy and simplicity. 



The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) created the California Solar Initiative (CSI) at the start of 2007 to manage the state PV rebate program and to help meet the solar goals set by the California greenhouse gas law, AB32. 









The CSI is funded by a ratepayer surcharge assessed by utilities.5 This surcharge contributes an average of \$217 million annually to the CSI.6 Three IOUs participate in the initiative—Pacific Gas and Electric (PG\&E), Southern California Edison (SCE) and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG\&E). Rebates are available for solar PV technologies as well as solar hot water heaters. 









We focus on incentives for residential solar PV installations which represent approximately \$500 million of the overall program budget.7 For these customers the CSI program offers two options, an upfront rebate based on predicted system electricity production, and a monthly payment based on actual production. Because relatively few customers select the monthly option, we focus on the upfront payment called the Expected Performance Based Buydown (EPBB).8 



 federal government offered a tax credit of up to 30 percent of system cost for homeowners who installed PV.  The credit was initially capped at \$2,000. However, the cap was removed after December 31, 2008 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Since the mean installation cost in our sample is approximately \$40,000, removal of the cap greatly increased the size of the federal incentive 









I think they are missing a big point - the reduction in PV prices around 2011! 



We use the date of the “first reservation request review” as the date for each project. The reservation request date is the date at which a customer first applies for CSI funds. It establishes a contract between the system owner and the CSI whereby the customer is guaranteed the CSI rebate rate at the time of the reservation request. 









However, solar installations appear clustered outside major cities. For example, there are relatively few installations in the most densely pop- ulated parts of the San Francisco and Los Angeles metro areas. Instead, solar counts are highest in a ring of zip codes outside each city. This likely reflects our focus on residential installations, which are more likely to occur on single family homes 
 
Since Glaeser and Kahn (2010) find that in general, CO2 emissions from electricity consumption are larger for sub- urban than for urban households, this pattern of adoption may magnify the effect of solar rebates on emissions.16 
 
Ito (2014) who investigates consumer responses to marginal and average electricity prices using the territory boundary between SCE and SDG\&E in Southern California. 
 
 
Installers may receive a federal tax credit under the Investment Tax Credit program based the fair-market value of leased systems. This may lead to misreporting of prices as alledged by the US Treasury. http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/10/treasury-dept-fingers-solarcity-in- exploration-of-the-dark-underbelly-of-solar-leasing. },

We find a low value for the real-time price elasticity, which may partly be explained from the fact that not all users observe the spot market price. If we correct for this phenomenon, we find the elasticity to be fairly low for consumers currently active in the spot market. If this conclusion applies to all users, this would imply a limited scope for government intervention in supply security issues.},

While this is only one to two percent of electricity costs, it illustrates a potential additional benefit from investment in retail Smart Grid applications, including the advanced electricity meters required to observe a household’s hourly consumption.},

By charting changes over time and investigating whether and when events occur, researchers reveal the temporal rhythms of our lives. Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis is a much-needed professional book for empirical researchers and graduate students in the behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences.  It offers the first accessible in-depth presentation of two of today's most popular statistical methods: multilevel models for individual change and hazard/survival models for event occurrence (in both discrete- and continuous-time). Using clear, concise prose and real data sets from published studies, the authors take you step by step through complete analyses, from simple exploratory displays that reveal underlying patterns through sophisticated specifications of complex statistical models.  Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis offers readers a private consultation session with internationally recognized experts and represents a unique contribution to the literature on quantitative empirical methods.

For the few firms that did make such trades, it was not profit-maximizing to eliminate the price differences entirely.

To accomplish this we introduce half-hourly measures of the firm-level ability and incentive of an individual supplier to exercise unilateral market power that are derived from a simplified model of expected profit-maximizing offer behaviour in a multi-unit auction market. We then show that half-hourly market-clearing prices are highly correlated with the half-hourly values of the firm-level and firm-average measures of both the ability and incentive of the four large suppliers in New Zealand to exercise market power. We then present evidence consistent with the view that this increasing relationship between the ability or incentive of individual suppliers to exercise market power and higher market-clearing prices is caused by the four large suppliers submitting higher offer prices when they have a greater ability or incentive to exercise unilateral market power. We show that after controlling for changes in input fossil fuel prices and other factors that impact the opportunity cost of producing electricity during that half hour, each of the four suppliers submits a higher offer price into the wholesale market when it has a greater ability or incentive to exercise unilateral market power. To strengthen the case that this increasing relationship between market prices and the ability and incentive of each of the suppliers to exercise unilateral market power is actually caused by the four large suppliers exercising unilateral market power by changing their offer prices in response to their ability and incentive to exercise market power, we also perform a test of the implications of the null hypothesis that the four large suppliers behave as if they had no ability to exercise market power. We find strong evidence against this null hypothesis and instead find that these hypothesis testing results are consistent with the perspective that these suppliers are exercising all available unilateral market power.},

On the one hand, the cost of installing solar PV may fall with cumulative installations. On the other hand, the costs associated with intermittency may increase with higher penetration 




The intermittency of solar PV generation requires a system operator to hold dispatchable generation in reserve to either fill in unanticipated drops in solar PV output or reduce output when solar PV output is unexpectedly high. Whereas the key techno- logical challenges in the cost of solar relate to materials and PV efficiency, the key technological challenges in grid integration relate to improvements in storage and grid controls. 




Several studies assess the intermittency of solar PV generation. A common metric is the delta: the change in the insolation index from one time interval to the next, measured as a fraction of maximum sunlight. Using solar insolation data from 23 instrument sites in Kansas and Oklahoma, Mills \& Wiser (2010) observe that deltas greater than 60.6 occur for timescales ranging from one minute to one hour. 




Because the electric grid matches aggregate generation to aggregate load, intermittency pres- ents less of a problem as PV sites become more geographically dispersed. Mills \& Wiser (2010) find that the correlation between deltas for pairs of sites decreases in the distance between sites and increases in the length of the timescale.




 For longer intervals such as 30 min, changes in solar PV output from one interval to the next would have fairly minor effects on grid operations if the changes could be accurately forecast several hours in advance: Generators would simply be dispatched with output rates set to compensate for the forecast changes in solar PV output. 












The cost of a PV system is made up of two parts: the module cost and the balance-of- system (BOS) cost. BOS costs typically include inverters, mounting hardware, and labor, but they may also be broadly defined to include permitting and fees, shipping, overhead, and installer profit. 








For residential and commercial PV, BOS costs have historically accounted for approximately 50\% of the total installed cost. With the recent drop in the cost of modules, BOS costs are now approaching two-thirds of system costs. When PV technologies are compared, costs are often presented in \$/Wp, or the cost per watt peak of dc power of a module or installed system. This number accounts for both the cost of manufacturing the module and the efficiency of the solar cell. 












There are significant economies of scale in solar PV installations. Barbose et al. (2012) report that large commercial rooftop systems (greater than 1 MW) cost 42\% less than residential rooftop systems on average, and utility-scale systems cost even less. 












These costs are adjusted to reflect the fact that lower efficiencies require panels to cover a greater area to provide a given quantity of power, which leads to higher BOS costs. The low values for the BOS costs are based on utility-scale installations; the high values are based on residential installations. 
 




In the power systems engineering literature, the system lambda parameter is derived from an economic least-cost dispatch model and represents the cost of the last kilowatt produced by dispatchable units over a particular hour (excluding transmission losses). 




 
 
 




A striking result illustrated by both Table 3 and Figure 2 is that the PV installations located in the colder locations with relatively low solar resource potential (i.e., New Jersey and Massachusetts) are more cost effective than the installation in relatively sunny California. Specifically, the break-even cost per Wp in San Francisco is below the break-even costs at the two installations in the northeast. The northeast’s advantage is due to emission-intensive generating units on the margin, greater marginal economic operating costs, and the stronger correlation between solar resource profiles and marginal economic cost profiles. 
 




One approach for examining how large-scale solar impacts the grid is to modify the standard screening curve methodology by treating intermittent renewable generation as negative load: The generation from a given amount of intermittent capacity is subtracted from load in each hour to obtain the residual (or net) load in each hour. The screening curve analysis may be applied to the load duration curve for residual loads to find optimal capacities for dispatchable technologies, given a fixed amount of intermittent capacity (Kelly \& Weinberg 1993). This modified screening curve methodology can provide insight into the impact of large-scale solar penetration on the rest of the grid, but it is not directly informative about the value of solar power. 
 




Lamont (2008) applies his methods to the 2001 California electric grid. As expected, the covariance term is negative for wind energy and positive for solar PV. The positive covariance of solar PV and l raises the marginal value of solar by 20\%; this estimate is at the high end of the range of short-term timing premia estimates for solar from Borenstein (2008).

Using household-level panel data from administrative records, I find strong evidence that consumers respond to average price rather than marginal or expected marginal price. This sub-optimizing behavior makes nonlinear pricing unsuccessful in achieving its policy goal of energy conservation and critically changes the welfare implications of nonlinear pricing.},

We randomized 725 students at a large, urban public university into the two formats, and unlike past studies, had a very high participation rate of 96 percent. Two experienced professors taught one section of each format, and students in both formats had access to the same online materials. We find that students in the traditional format scored 2.3 percentage points more on a 100-point scale on the combined midterm and final. There were no differences between formats in non-cognitive effort (attendance, time spent with online materials) nor in withdrawal from the class. Comparing our experimental estimates of the effect of attendance with non-experimental estimates using only students in the traditional format, we find that the non-experimental were 2.5 times larger, suggesting that the large effects of attending lectures found in the previous literature are likely due to selection bias. Overall our results suggest that hybrid classes may offer a cost effective alternative to traditional lectures while having a small impact on student performance.},

	abstract = {So far, solar energy has been viewed as only a minor contributor in the energy mixture of the US due to cost and intermittency constraints. However, recent drastic cost reductions in the production of photovoltaics (PV) pave the way for enabling this technology to become cost competitive with fossil fuel energy generation. We show that with the right incentives, cost competitiveness with grid prices in the US (e.g., 6–10 US¢/kWh) can be attained by 2020. The intermittency problem is solved by integrating PV with compressed air energy storage (CAES) and by extending the thermal storage capability in concentrated solar power (CSP). We used hourly load data for the entire US and 45-year solar irradiation data from the southwest region of the US, to simulate the CAES storage requirements, under worst weather conditions. Based on expected improvements of established, commercially available PV, CSP, and CAES technologies, we show that solar energy has the technical, geographical, and economic potential to supply 69\% of the total electricity needs and 35\% of the total (electricity and fuel) energy needs of the US by 2050. When we extend our scenario to 2100, solar energy supplies over 90\%, and together with other renewables, 100\% of the total US energy demand with a corresponding 92\% reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions compared to the 2005 levels.},

	abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has matured to become a technically viable large-scale source of sustainable energy. Understanding the rooftop PV potential is critical for utility planning, accommodating grid capacity, deploying financing schemes and formulating future adaptive energy policies. This paper demonstrates techniques to merge the capabilities of geographic information systems and object-specific image recognition to determine the available rooftop area for PV deployment in an example large-scale region in south eastern Ontario. A five-step procedure has been developed for estimating total rooftop PV potential which involves geographical division of the region; sampling using the Feature Analyst extraction software; extrapolation using roof area-population relationships; reduction for shading, other uses and orientation; and conversion to power and energy outputs. Limitations faced in terms of the capabilities of the software and determining the appropriate fraction of roof area available are discussed. Because this aspect of the analysis uses an integral approach, PV potential will not be georeferenced, but rather presented as an agglomerate value for use in regional policy making. A relationship across the region was found between total roof area and population of 70.0 m2/capita ± 6.2\%. With appropriate roof tops covered with commercial solar cells, the potential PV peak power output from the region considered is 5.74 GW (157\% of the region’s peak power demands) and the potential annual energy production is 6909 GWh (5\% of Ontario’s total annual demand). This suggests that 30\% of Ontario’s energy demand can be met with province-wide rooftop PV deployment. This new understanding of roof area distribution and potential PV outputs will guide energy policy formulation in Ontario and will inform future research in solar PV deployment and its geographical potential.},

Also this paper discussed the existing successful solar energy policies of few selected countries. Based on literatures, it has been found that FIT, RPS and incentives are the most beneficial energy policies implemented by many countries around the world. These policies provide significant motivation and interest for the development and use of renewable energy technologies.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore why the Nordic electricity market has worked quite well and to consider to what extent the Nordic experiences are relevant for other countries. In particular, we investigate causes as to why the Nordic market managed to withstand the supply shock in 2002–2003. A comparison is made with the California case, and the potential problem of market power abuse is investigated in particular. The relatively successful electricity market reform in the Nordic countries seems to be attributable to the followings: a simple but sound market design, a successful dilution of market power, a strong political support for deregulation and voluntary, informal commitment to public service by the power industry.},

They submit a supply schedule of prices for generation and receive the market-clearing price, which varies with demand. Despite claims that this should be highly competitive, we show that the Nash equilibrium in supply schedules implies a high markup on marginal cost and substantial deadweight losses. Further simulations, to show the effect of entry by 1994, produce somewhat lower prices, at the cost of excessive entry; subdividing the generators into five firms would produce better results.},

Since the date at which renewables are phased in is brought forward and more generally future emissions of CO2 will decrease, the effect on global warming is unclear. Green welfare falls if the backstop is relatively expensive and full exhaustion of fossil fuels is optimal, but may increase if the backstop is sufficiently cheap relative to the cost of extracting the last drop of fossil fuels plus marginal global warming damages as then it is attractive to leave more fossil fuels unexploited and thus limit CO2 emissions. We establish these results by analyzing depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels followed by a switch to a clean renewable backstop, paying attention to timing of the switch and the amount of fossil fuels remaining unexploited. We also discuss the potential for limit pricing when the non-renewable resource is owned by a monopolist. Finally, we show that if backstops are already used and more backstops become economically viable as the price of fossil fuels rises, a lower cost of the backstop will either postpone fossil fuel exhaustion or leave more fossil fuel in situ, thus boosting green welfare. However, if a market economy does not internalize global warming externalities and renewables have not kicked in yet, full exhaustion of fossil fuel will occur in finite time and a backstop subsidy always curbs green welfare.},

	abstract = {AbstractIndividual countries are in the process of legislating responses to the challenges posed by climate change. The prospect of rising carbon prices raises concerns in these nations about the effects on the competitiveness of their own energy-intensive industries and the potential for carbon leakage, particularly leakage to emerging economies that lack comparable regulation. In response, certain developed countries are proposing controversial trade-related measures and allowance allocation designs to complement their climate policies. Missing from much of the debate on trade-related measures is a broader understanding of how climate policies implemented unilaterally (or subglobally) affect all countries in the global trading system. Arguably, the largest impacts are from the targeted carbon pricing itself, which generates macroeconomic effects, terms-of-trade changes, and shifts in global energy demand and prices; it also changes the relative prices of certain energy-intensive goods. This paper studies how climate policies implemented in certain major economies (the European Union and the United States) affect the global distribution of economic and environmental outcomes and how these outcomes may be altered by complementary policies aimed at addressing carbon leakage.},

We assess three widely discussed proposals for leakage reduction: carbon-motivated border tax adjustments, industry exemptions from carbon regulation, and output-based allocation of emission allowances. We find that none of these measures amounts to a “magic bullet” when both efficiency and equity criteria matter. Compared to unilateral emission pricing alone, border carbon adjustments are most effective in leakage reduction and promotion of global cost-effectiveness but can markedly exacerbate regional inequality; exemptions and output-based allocation tend to avoid distributional pitfalls but are less effective in leakage reduction and global cost savings; exemptions may even decrease global cost-effectiveness of unilateral emission abatement.},

Specifically, when panel data are available for firms in an industry, time-specific dummies can be combined in a nonlinear estimation procedure to yield a general index of technical change that may be both nonneutral and scale augmenting. This approach offers numerous advantages over the traditional time trend representation of technical change. For example, the general index can serve as the basis for analysis of the determinants of technical change. Results for a sample of 30 electric utilities over the period 1951-78 show that the productivity decline of the 1970s can be attributed primarily to sulphur oxide restrictions and secularly declining capacity utilization due to rapidly increasing peak-load demands.},

	abstract = {Exploration for oil or gas reserves consists of searching for and finding new reserves. It begins with the study of the geology of an area followed by exploratory or wildcat drilling in promising areas. How much oil or gas is found or the supply of new reserves is a function of exploration, the geology of the area drilled along with a random component measuring the fickleness of mother nature in yielding up her treasures to mere mortals. Knowing how oil and gas prices affect this process (price elasticities) is valuable to those who are involved with this strategic industry. Economic theory suggests that the search for petroleum is affected by prices and can be characterized by functions representing geophysical activities and drilling while the finding of reserves can be characterized by some sort of discovery process. The earliest econometric approach to modeling oil and gas exploration, which yielded price elasticities, was to estimate the search process using a function for wildcat wells drilled (Ww). For example, the discovery process for oil was represented using two equations: a success rate equation \% of wells that are commercially successful (W/Ww) and an average oil reserve per successful well equation (O/W). Each of these three dependent variables were dependent on price and other relevant variables. The product of these three variables (Ww∗W/Ww∗O/W) yields the supply of oil reserves (O). In this paper we survey all U.S. exploration models for oil and gas that include wells drilled, share of successful wells, average reserves per well, or total reserve equations. We focus our survey on price elasticities to capture the effect of market price on the exploration process. Drilling equation results tend to be good with drilling strongly influenced by oil price and we suspect the long run drilling oil price elasticity to be greated than 1. It is much less clear how natural gas prices have affected drilling but their effect seems to be increasing. The most important issue in drilling equations besides including the correct economic variables is more work to clarify what geological variables provide the best forecasts. The econometric estimates for successful wells and average reserves per wells are much poorer and we would recommend more systematic work on discovery models to determine which perform the best.},

	abstract = {Departing from Hotelling’s assumption of fixed and known reserves, this paper develops an economic model of additions to proven reserves that explicitly incorporates the effects of expected resource price, cumulative reserves development, and technological progress on reserve additions. The model treats additions to proven oil reserves as output of a production process in which drilling wells is a primary input to transform some of oil-in-place into the economic category of proven reserves. Application of the model to US data for the 1950–1995 period provides strong statistical support for the existence of all the three salient effects. We obtain an estimate of the price elasticity of reserve additions (absent from previous studies) which, although statistically highly significant, is rather small. Using this price elasticity estimate, it is shown that if in the face of steady economic growth, and hence, oil consumption, US oil import dependence is to be kept from rising in the future, ceteris paribus, a steady oil price increase in the range of 1.5–4.5\% a year is essential.},

The EnKF has a large user group, and numerous publications have discussed applications and theoretical aspects of it. This paper reviews the important results from these studies and also presents new ideas and alternative interpretations which further explain the success of the EnKF. In addition to providing the theoretical framework needed for using the EnKF, there is also a focus on the algorithmic formulation and optimal numerical implementation. A program listing is given for some of the key subroutines. The paper also touches upon specific issues such as the use of nonlinear measurements, in situ profiles of temperature and salinity, and data which are available with high frequency in time. An ensemble based optimal interpolation (EnOI) scheme is presented as a cost-effective approach which may serve as an alternative to the EnKF in some applications. A fairly extensive discussion is devoted to the use of time correlated model errors and the estimation of model bias.},

We introduce a finding cost function that among other factors depends on the cumulative number of past R\&D expenses and cumulative past production, measuring technological change and depletion, respectively. For all our regions we find significant effects of both depletion and technological change on oil finding costs from 1981 to 2009, barring cyclical variations in finding costs that could come from changes in factor prices. For almost all regions technology more than mitigated depletion until around the mid-nineties. However, we find that depletion outweighed technological progress over the last decade.},

The framework is the familiar system of factor-demand equations derived from a cost function. The state of technology, a latent variable, is modeled as a stochastic trend. In addition, estimates of total-factor productivity are corrected for measurement error that induces a procyclibal bias. As a result of decoupling trend and cyclical components and using state-space estimation techniques, significant cost changes are uncovered that fail to be detected when more traditional methods are employed. The application is to the U.S. primary-metals industry and the estimates appear to be consistent with the stylized facts in this sector.},

The study supports the hypothesis that technological progress has mitigated depletion effects for our case study, but the pattern differs from the conventional wisdom for non-renewable resource industries. Contrary to the usual assumptions of monotonic changes in productivity or an inverted “U”-shaped pattern, we found that productivity declined for the first 30 years of our study period. But more recently, the rapid pace of technological change has outpaced depletion and productivity has increased rapidly, particularly in most recent 5 years of our study period. We also provide a more thorough understanding of different components of technological change and depletion.},

A partial equilibrium model for the global oil market is applied to compare the effects of these tacitly collusive capital constraints on oil supply with an alternative characterised by industrial stability. Our results suggest that even temporary economic and financial shocks may have a long-term impact on oil price formation.},

The increasing pressure for strict capital discipline among oil and gas companies may have reduced their willingness to invest for future reserves and production growth. The current high oil price is partly due to low exploration activity in the oil industry the last decade. We present and discuss the background for this development—based on previous academic research, industry trends and current valuation practices. An estimated econometric model of stock market valuation among oil and gas companies suggests that analysts and companies have put exaggerate weight on short-term earnings and accounting profitability.

We provide the first evidence on the nature of these forecasts by analyzing two decades of data on gasoline price expectations from the Michigan Survey of Consumers. We find that average consumer beliefs are typically indistinguishable from a no-change forecast, justifying an assumption commonly made in the literature on consumer valuation of energy efficiency. We also provide evidence on circumstances in which consumer forecasts are likely to deviate from no-change and on significant cross-consumer forecast heterogeneity.},

This article presents new evidence on how price changes and conservation appeals affect energy consumption, using household-level data from California's energy crisis during 2000 and 2001. The evidence indicates that when policymakers cap energy prices following market shocks, they preclude substantial—and quite rapid—reductions in energy use. The data also reveal that conservation appeals and informational programs can produce sustained reductions in energy demand.},

	abstract = {This paper uses three different sources of data to investigate the association between the business cycle—measured with unemployment rates—and environmental concern. Building on recent research that finds internet search terms to be useful predictors of health epidemics and economic activity, we find that an increase in a state’s unemployment rate decreases Google searches for “global warming” and increases searches for “unemployment,” and that the effect differs according to a state’s political ideology. From national surveys, we find that an increase in a state’s unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in the probability that residents think global warming is happening and reduced support for the U.S to target policies intended to mitigate global warming. Finally, in California, we find that an increase in a county’s unemployment rate is associated with a significant decrease in county residents choosing the environment as the most important policy issue. Beyond providing the first empirical estimates of macroeconomic effects on environmental concern, we discuss the results in terms of the potential impact on environmental policy and understanding the full cost of recessions.},

During other times, offset purchasing patterns for zip codes inside the 10-mile radius were similar to the patterns of zip codes outside the 10-mile radius. There is, however, little evidence that individuals who purchased an offset due to the film purchased them again a year later.},

	abstract = {Summary. I discuss the production of low rank smoothers for d ≥ 1 dimensional data, which can be fitted by regression or penalized regression methods. The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with ‘knot placement’ that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Despite their widespread use as predictors of the spot price of oil, oil futures prices tend to be less accurate in the mean-squared prediction error sense than no-change forecasts. This result is driven by the variability of the futures price about the spot price, as captured by the oil futures spread. This variability can be explained by the marginal convenience yield of oil inventories. Using a two-country, multi-period general equilibrium model of the spot and futures markets for crude oil we show that increased uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls under plausible assumptions causes the spread to decline. Increased uncertainty also causes precautionary demand for oil to increase, resulting in an immediate increase in the real spot price. Thus the negative of the oil futures spread may be viewed as an indicator of fluctuations in the price of crude oil driven by precautionary demand. An empirical analysis of this indicator provides evidence of how shifts in the uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls affect the real spot price of crude oil.

Selecting the correct weights for penalties is a critical part of using these methods and in the single-penalty case the analyst has several well-founded techniques to choose from. However, many modelling problems suggest a formulation employing multiple penalties, and here general methodology is lacking. A wide family of models with multiple penalties can be fitted to data by iterative solution of the generalized ridge regression problem minimize {\textbar}{\textbar}W1/2 (Xp−y) {\textbar}{\textbar}2ρ+Σi=1m θip′Sip (p is a parameter vector, X a design matrix, Si a non-negative definite coefficient matrix defining the ith penalty with associated smoothing parameter θi, W a diagonal weight matrix, y a vector of data or pseudodata and ρ an ‘overall’ smoothing parameter included for computational efficiency). This paper shows how smoothing parameter selection can be performed efficiently by applying generalized cross-validation to this problem and how this allows non-linear, generalized linear and linear models to be fitted using multiple penalties, substantially increasing the scope of penalized modelling methods.

	abstract = {Summary. Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

	abstract = {In many petroleum basins, and especially in more mature areas, most reserve additions consist of the growth over time of prior discoveries, a phenomenon termed reserve appreciation. This paper concerns crude oil reserve appreciation in both the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. It examines the change in reserves attributed to North Sea fields over time, seeking to reveal patterns of reserve appreciation both for individual fields and for groups of fields classified by potentially relevant common elements. These include field size, year of production start-up, geological age, gravity, depth and depletion rate. The paper emphasizes the statistical analysis of reserve appreciation. It contrasts the Norwegian and UK experience. An important distinction is drawn between appreciation of oil-in-place and changes in recovery factors. North Sea oil reserve appreciation between production start-up and the last observation year (usually 1996) is found to be substantial, but generally lacks a consistent profile. Appreciation recorded for the Norwegian fields on average is considerably greater than for the UK. Most UK appreciation is seemingly accounted for by oil-in-place; in Norway, from increases in recovery factors. However, UK recovery factors commence at much higher levels than those for Norway.},

The model can be used to determine better world oil supplies. Price is tested, to see how powerful it is for increasing or decreasing oil supply. Using a trend of cumulative production, instead of time, will help to better fix the supply elasticity with respect to price, which is shown to be very inelastic. An interesting question is whether cumulative discovery or production constitutes an I(2) variable. This paper explains that they are not I(2) variables.},

The emphasis of the paper is on econometric and forecasting issues, and it discusses alternative methods of estimating Hubbert's model. Using data on oil production in the U.S. lower 48 states, the paper reports the results of estimating the various specifications of the model and its extensions by the maximum-likelihood method, and provides the implied estimates for ultimate resource recovery and their associated standard errors. When economic factors are taken into account the estimates of ultimate resource recovery become state-dependent, and we find that in this case the estimates are higher than those obtained from the various specifications of Hubbert's original model. Although the accuracy of the estimates of ultimate recoverable reserves cannot be evaluated before oil reserves are actually exhausted, we examine how the various models estimated over the periods 1926–1985 and 1948–1985 perform in predicting oil production over the 1986–1990 period.},

We estimate a vector error correction model for oil production in the lower 48 states that specifies real oil prices, average production costs, and prorationing by the Texas Railroad Commission. These modifications enable us to generate a model that accounts for most of the variation in oil production in the lower 48 states between 1938 and 1991. The result that oil production in the lower 48 states shares stochastic trends with real oil prices, average production costs, and prorationing indicates that accuracy of Hubbert's bell shaped curve is fortuitous. The importance of these factors also indicates why the basic Hotelling model cannot replicate the production path for oil in the lower 48 states. This inability is critical. The negative economic effects associated with high prices and energy shortages imply that the importance of inconsistencies with the basic Hotelling model identified by this analysis may be sufficient to warrant a greater degree of government intervention in the transition from oil than is currently envisioned by most policy makers.},

However, such a conclusion may be premature given that much of the increase in the success rate occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, well before the major advancements in seismic technology. The conclusion may also be premature in that it ignores the relationship between price and the success rate. Increases in the price may positively (negatively) affect the success rate. Given this, and the decline in price over the past decade, one would expect the success rate to have declined (increased) in the absence of technological change.

	abstract = {Exploration for oil or gas reserves consists of searching for and finding new reserves. It begins with the study of the geology of an area followed by exploratory or wildcat drilling in promising areas. How much oil or gas is found or the supply of new reserves is a function of exploration, the geology of the area drilled along with a random component measuring the fickleness of mother nature in yielding up her treasures to mere mortals. Knowing how oil and gas prices affect this process (price elasticities) is valuable to those who are involved with this strategic industry. Economic theory suggests that the search for petroleum is affected by prices and can be characterized by functions representing geophysical activities and drilling while the finding of reserves can be characterized by some sort of discovery process. The earliest econometric approach to modeling oil and gas exploration, which yielded price elasticities, was to estimate the search process using a function for wildcat wells drilled (Ww). For example, the discovery process for oil was represented using two equations: a success rate equation \% of wells that are commercially successful (W/Ww) and an average oil reserve per successful well equation (O/W). Each of these three dependent variables were dependent on price and other relevant variables. The product of these three variables (Ww∗W/Ww∗O/W) yields the supply of oil reserves (O). In this paper we survey all U.S. exploration models for oil and gas that include wells drilled, share of successful wells, average reserves per well, or total reserve equations. We focus our survey on price elasticities to capture the effect of market price on the exploration process. Drilling equation results tend to be good with drilling strongly influenced by oil price and we suspect the long run drilling oil price elasticity to be greated than 1. It is much less clear how natural gas prices have affected drilling but their effect seems to be increasing. The most important issue in drilling equations besides including the correct economic variables is more work to clarify what geological variables provide the best forecasts. The econometric estimates for successful wells and average reserves per wells are much poorer and we would recommend more systematic work on discovery models to determine which perform the best.},

Concern about the effect of this dependence on economic and national security has focused attention on the domestic resource base: how much oil awaits discovery and at what rate can it be produced? We analyze the adequacy of domestic resources by updating and modifying in important new ways the models of discovery and production developed by M. King Hubbert. Hubbert's models have been a lightning rod for debate about the future of oil resources because they have been the most accurate on record. When we include real oil prices and the annual rate of drilling effort in Hubbert's model of oil discovery, there is no evidence for claims that the secular decline in discoveries per foot of well drilled has been arrested or reversed in the lower forty-eight states. Our results indicate that there is little oil waiting to be found in unexplored sedimentary formations in the lower forty-eight states using conventional exploration techniques. Furthermore, we show that the declining quality of the resource base has offset the positive stimuli of price increases and changes in government policy towards a free market. Having passed through a period in which production in the lower forty-eight states fell 20 percent while real oil prices tripled there seems little that the U.S. government can do to alter the bottom line for domestic operators so that U.S. production can displace imports to a significant degree. We conclude that the conventional supply side offers little room to manoeuvre around increased dependence on imported oil.},

The analysis shows that the alternative minimum tax has reduced by 9\% the optimal number of exploration wells as compared to the optimal number of exploration wells prior to the introduction of the alternative minimum tax. The analysis also shows that the alternative minimum tax has 1) reduced the optimal level of exploration risk and 2) increased the importance of well-designed incentive compensation agreements for firms operating in the extractive petroleum industry.},

	abstract = {This study draws on other studies that concluded OPEC is not a cartel and Saudi Arabia acts as a dominant producer in the world oil market. The intention here is to see whether the Target Revenue (TR) model provides an explanation for the behavior of some OPEC members that do not coordinate production with Saudi Arabia. We investigate whether production cuts or increases by OPEC and non OPEC members are based on their investment or budgetary needs. By retesting the TR model, we show that investment and budgetary needs do not affect the production of oil in free-market economies (OPEC and non-OPEC), but they do affect production decisions of the more centrally-planned, isolated and oil dependent economies. Existing studies in the literature have conceptual and statistical limitations that justify retesting the model. This study is the first to investigate the TR model in a separate study and to compare the results of static and dynamic models. It is also the first to examine the relationship between the degree of economic freedom and the Target Revenue model and to note the TR model is stable when used for countries that are price takers.},

	abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

This paper seeks to redress this through an analysis of the economic development opportunities surrounding wind energy development in rural Wales. The paper concludes that the economic development outcomes to rural areas from wind generation projects to date have been questionable. Increasing the flow of conventional economic benefits to rural economies in terms of incomes and jobs is shown to be difficult because of the nature of the local supply side in remote areas. Partially as a consequence of this, developers of wind farms have come to routinely provide diverse forms of community benefits to ‘affected communities’, but these have yet to evolve into significant tools of economic development. In any case, the flows of revenues from community benefits are dwarfed, in quantitative terms, by the revenue streams that might be channelled to rural areas through a broader community ownership of wind energy projects. However, although a few local successes have been achieved, the scope for realising the returns from community ownership remains low in the Welsh case, with a series of impediments considered. We close the paper by suggesting means through which economic outputs might be improved.},

This paper focuses on how the ownership structure of on-shore wind power plants (external, farmer or community) affects the size and distribution of impacts within the rural part of a region. Empirical analysis is based on a regional computable general equilibrium model of North East Scotland with the results compared to those generated from a standard social accounting matrix multiplier analysis. With no local ownership, while rural GDP increases, there is almost no effect on household incomes due to the limited direct linkages of the on-shore wind sector. Local ownership increases the household income benefits but there are still limited positive spill-over effects on the wider economy unless factor income is re-invested in local capital. With re-investment, farm household ownership gives rise to the largest increase in total household income but community ownership gives rise to the largest increase in rural (non-farm) household incomes and welfare. The results contribute to the on-going debate about the opportunity cost of external asset ownership in rural areas.},

The objectives of the paper are to provide: (a) a survey of previous regional-economic assessments of wind power projects; as well as (b) a quantitative assessment of the employment impacts of an ongoing wind farm investment in the Swedish county of Norrbotten under different benefit-sharing scenarios. Our model-based input–output analysis confirms many of the findings of previous research, such as significant construction work impacts, especially in the presence of local manufacturing. The analysis also illustrates that in the absence of any benefit-sharing mechanism, the employment impacts for Norrbotten during the operating phase will be modest (with an employment multiplier of 1.4). However, even if a relatively low share of the wind power revenues is assumed to accrue to the local government this would have significant positive impacts on employment rates. For this reason, additional research on various types of benefit-sharing instruments is called for, including studies of the associated challenges and trade-offs.},

Job losses in the coal and natural gas industry are modeled to project net employment impacts. Benefits and drawbacks of the methodology are assessed and the resulting model is used for job projections under various renewable portfolio standards (RPS), EE, and low carbon energy scenarios We find that all non-fossil fuel technologies (renewable energy, EE, low carbon) create more jobs per unit energy than coal and natural gas. Aggressive EE measures combined with a 30\% RPS target in 2030 can generate over 4 million full-time-equivalent job-years by 2030 while increasing nuclear power to 25\% and CCS to 10\% of overall generation in 2030 can yield an additional 500,000 job-years.},

Although a growing RE industry can be observed in Germany the overall effect of large increases of RE based electricity and heat generating technologies on the German economy require a careful model based analysis. The applied model PANTA RHEI has been used among others to evaluate the German energy concept in 2010. It takes positive and negative impacts of RE into account. The paper shows the overall effects under different assumptions for fossil fuel prices, domestic installations and international trade. The results are sensitive to assumptions on the development of RE world markets and German exports to these markets. Almost all of these scenarios exhibit positive net employment effects. Under medium assumptions net employment of RE expansion will reach around 150 thousand in 2030. Only with assumptions for German RE exports below today's level, net impacts are slightly negative. Gross employment will increase from 340 thousand in 2009 to between 500 and 600 thousand in 2030.},

	abstract = {Between 2008–2012, electricity generated (GWh) from coal, the longtime dominant fuel for electric power in the US, declined 24\%, while electricity generated from natural gas, wind and solar grew by 39\%, 154\%, and 400\%, respectively. These shifts had major effects on domestic employment in those sectors of the coal, natural gas, wind and solar industries involved in operations and maintenance (O\&amp;M) activities for electricity generation. Using an economic input–output model, we estimate that the coal industry lost more than 49,000 jobs (12\%) nationally over the five-year period, while in the natural gas, solar, and wind industries, employment increased by nearly 175,000 jobs (21\%). We also combine published ratios for jobs per unit of fuel production and per megawatt of power plant capacity with site-specific data on fuel production and power plant retirements, additions and capacity changes to estimate and map direct job changes at the county level. The maps show that job increases in the natural gas, solar and wind industries generally did not occur where there were significant job losses in the coal industry, particularly in West Virginia and Kentucky.},

	abstract = {The ageing of existing energy system infrastructure, the threat of climate change and uncertainty in the movement of energy prices have resulted in a widespread agreement on the need for a transition to a low carbon energy system. Yet the nature of this transition (i.e. what, when, how and where) and its socio-economic outcomes at different scales are not well understood. The interdependence of the energy sector and economic growth has been mostly studied at the national level (via some general equilibrium or econometric models) whilst sub-national studies at community or urban levels mostly focus on the governance of transitions. Hence, we suggest that a regional perspective to energy policy and research promises to integrate these two approaches by providing a more robust and comprehensive understanding of the implications of low carbon transitions, as well as contributing to the development of more effective policies. By building on recent ideas on geographical aspects of energy transitions, this article offers insights on the changing relationship between the spatial organisation of economic activities and energy systems, and identifies tools and methods from urban and regional planning to help with the delivery of efficient and equitable policy outcomes.},

Focussing on the UK Government's policy for a low carbon transition, the paper provides a conceptual language with which to describe and assess the geographical implications of a transition towards low carbon energy. Six concepts are introduced and explained: location, landscape, territoriality, spatial differentiation, scaling, and spatial embeddedness. Examples illustrate how the geographies of a future low-carbon economy are not yet determined and that a range of divergent – and contending – potential geographical futures are in play. More attention to the spaces and places that transition to a low-carbon economy will produce can help better understand what living in a low-carbon economy will be like. It also provides a way to help evaluate the choices and pathways available.},

Using both analytical and input–output models this paper analyzes the direct and indirect employment impacts of two main mitigation policies in the power generation sector. This paper proves that the above-mentioned question is not simple. Mitigation policies in China’s power generation sector from 2006 to 2009 caused a total of 44 thousand net jobs losses. However, as the share of renewable energy that has an indirect employment impacts increased in 2010, the policies from 2006 to 2010 actually resulted in 472 thousand net job gains. This paper asserts that to ensure the co-existence of green economy and green jobs in China’s power generation sector, policy makers should further promote solar PV, biomass and wind technologies. In 2010, for every one percent increase in the share of solar PV generation there could be a 0.68\% increase in total employment in China, larger than any other power generation technology. Finally, this paper argues that a matching educational system and personnel structure is also needed.},

I estimate these gains for counties in Colorado, Texas, and Wyoming, three states where natural gas production expanded substantially since the late 1990s. I find that a large increase in the value of gas production caused modest increases in employment, wage and salary income, and median household income. The results suggest that each million dollars in gas production created 2.35 jobs in the county of production, which led to an annualized increase in employment that was 1.5\% of the pre-boom level for the average gas boom county. Comparisons show that ex-ante estimates of the number of jobs created by developing the Fayetteville and Marcellus shale gas formations may have been too large.},

We combine new data on oil and gas endowments with Census of Manufactures microdata to estimate how oil and gas booms affect local economies in the United States. Migration does not fully offset labor demand growth, so local wages rise. Notwithstanding, manufacturing is actually procyclical with resource booms, driven by growth in upstream and locally-traded sectors. As of the end of the 1990s, there were no remaining effects of the boom and bust of the 1970s and 1980s on manufacturing productivity and other economic outcomes. This implies that “learning-by-doing” effects, which are central to the Dutch Disease story, were not significant. Over the full 1969-2014 sample, a county with one standard deviation additional oil and gas endowment averaged about one percent higher real wages.},

In this paper, we provide the first estimates of broad-scale welfare and distributional implications of this supply boom. We provide new estimates of supply and demand elasticities, which we use to estimate the drop in natural gas prices that is attributable to the supply expansion. We calculate large, positive welfare impacts for four broad sectors of gas consumption (residential, commercial, industrial, and electric power), and a negative impact for producers, with variation across regions. We then examine the evidence for a gas-led "manufacturing renaissance" and for pass-through to prices of products such as retail natural gas, retail electricity, and commodity chemicals. We conclude with a discussion of environmental externalities from unconventional natural gas, including limitations of the current regulatory environment. Overall, we find that between 2007 and 2013 the shale gas revolution led to an increase in welfare for natural gas consumers and producers of \$48 billion per year, but more data are needed on the extent and valuation of the environmental impacts of shale gas production.},

Although the specifics of what constitutes a better life vary from generation to generation, one constant is that children expect to do better—or at least to have a good chance at doing better—than their parents. Chetty et al. show that this dream did come true for children born in the middle of the 20th century, but only for half of children born in 1984 (see the Policy Forum by Katz and Krueger). A more even distribution of economic growth, rather than more growth, would allow more children to fulfill their dreams. Science, this issue p. 398; see also p. 382 We estimated rates of “absolute income mobility”—the fraction of children who earn more than their parents—by combining data from U.S. Census and Current Population Survey cross sections with panel data from de-identified tax records. We found that rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90\% for children born in 1940 to 50\% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70\% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that reviving the “American dream” of high rates of absolute mobility would require economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution. Only half of Americans see their dreams come true. Only half of Americans see their dreams come true.},

It is both a threat and a godsend for the environment, and it is leading the revival of manufacturing in the United States. A definitive narrative history, The Boom follows the twists and turns in the development and adoption of this radical technology. It is a thrilling journey filled with colorful characters: the green-minded Texas oilman who created the first modern frack; a bare-knuckled Oklahoman natural gas empire-builder who gave the world an enormous new supply of energy and was brought down by his own success and excesses; an environmental leader whose embrace of fracking brought an end to his public career; and an aging fracking pioneer who is now trying to save the industry from itself. A fascinating and exciting exploration of one of the most controversial and promising sources of energy, The Boom “brings new clarity to a subject awash in hype from all sides…a thoughtful, well-written, and carefully researched book that provides the best overview yet of the pros and cons of fracking.

Between 2000 and 2007, the economy gave back the considerable employment gains achieved during the 1990s, with a historic contraction in manufacturing employment being a prime contributor to the slump. We estimate that import competition from China, which surged after 2000, was a major force behind both recent reductions in US manufacturing employment and—through input-output linkages and other general equilibrium channels—weak overall US job growth. Our central estimates suggest job losses from rising Chinese import competition over 1999–2011 in the range of 2.0–2.4 million.},

Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations (employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled labor.},

	abstract = {A central organizing framework of the voluminous recent literature studying changes in the returns to skills and the evolution of earnings inequality is what we refer to as the canonical model, which elegantly and powerfully operationalizes the supply and demand for skills by assuming two distinct skill groups that perform two different and imperfectly substitutable tasks or produce two imperfectly substitutable goods. Technology is assumed to take a factor-augmenting form, which, by complementing either high or low skill workers, can generate skill biased demand shifts. In this paper, we argue that despite its notable successes, the canonical model is largely silent on a number of central empirical developments of the last three decades, including: (1) significant declines in real wages of low skill workers, particularly low skill males; (2) non-monotone changes in wages at different parts of the earnings distribution during different decades; (3) broad-based increases in employment in high skill and low skill occupations relative to middle skilled occupations (i.e., job “polarization’’); (4) rapid diffusion of new technologies that directly substitute capital for labor in tasks previously performed by moderately skilled workers; and (5) expanding offshoring in opportunities, enabled by technology, which allow foreign labor to substitute for domestic workers specific tasks. Motivated by these patterns, we argue that it is valuable to consider a richer framework for analyzing how recent changes in the earnings and employment distribution in the United States and other advanced economies are shaped by the interactions among worker skills, job tasks, evolving technologies, and shifting trading opportunities. We propose a tractable task-based model in which the assignment of skills to tasks is endogenous and technical change may involve the substitution of machines for certain tasks previously performed by labor. We further consider how the evolution of technology in this task-based setting may be endogenized. We show how such a framework can be used to interpret several central recent trends, and we also suggest further directions for empirical exploration.},

	abstract = {Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are here united in one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes – the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size ε and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter ε on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

Firms with higher financial reporting quality also are found to deviate less from predicted investment levels and show less sensitivity to macro-economic conditions.

We find that in only 15\% of firm-years is there some question as to a firm's ability to access internal or external funds to increase investment. Strikingly, those firms that appear less financially constrained exhibit a significantly greater investment- cash flow sensitivity than firms that appear more financially constrained. We find this pattern for the entire sample period, for sub-periods, and for individual years. The results indicate that a higher sensitivity cannot be interpreted as evidence that a firm is more financially constrained. We discuss reasons and provide evidence why the opposite may be true. These findings challenge much of the existing evidence on the effects of financial constraints.},

We examine the role of FRQ in private firms from emerging markets, a setting in which extant research suggests that FRQ would be less conducive to the mitigation of investment inefficiencies. Earlier studies show that private firms have lower FRQ, presumably because of lower market demand for public information. Prior research also shows that FRQ is lower in countries with low investor protection, bank-oriented financial systems, and stronger conformity between tax and financial reporting rules. Using firm-level data from the World Bank, our empirical evidence suggests that FRQ positively affects investment efficiency. We further find that the relation between FRQ and investment efficiency is increasing in bank financing and decreasing in incentives to minimize earnings for tax purposes. Such a connection between tax-minimization incentives and the informational role of earnings has often been asserted in the literature. We provide explicit evidence in this regard.},

	abstract = {Abstract:  This paper explores direct relations between corporate investment behavior and the timeliness of accounting recognition of economic losses (TLR) reflected in a country's accounting regime. We explicitly investigate the extent to which TLR influences investment decisions of firm managers. Given the asymmetric emphasis on negative outcomes inherent in TLR, we hypothesize that TLR will most strongly influence investment behavior when managers face deteriorating investment environments. We conjecture that TLR will have an asymmetric impact on investment behavior whereby TLR impacts firms’ investment decisions in the face of declining investment opportunities, but not in the face of increasing in investment opportunities. Using firm-level investment decisions spanning twenty five countries, we find that investment responses to declining opportunities increases with TLR, while we find no evidence that TLR influences the sensitivity of investment to increasing investment opportunities. Our results are robust to alternative estimates of TLR, alternative estimates of investment responses to changing investment opportunities, and to controls for important country-level, industry-level, and firm-level variables that may impact firms’ investment decisions.},

Our first hypothesis is that higher quality accounting enhances investment efficiency by reducing information asymmetry between managers and outside suppliers of capital. Our second hypothesis is that this effect should be stronger in economies where financing is largely provided through arm's-length transactions compared with countries where creditors supply more capital. Our results are consistent with these hypotheses both across and within countries. They are robust to alternative econometric specifications, different measures of accounting quality and investment-cash flow sensitivity, and numerous control variables.},

We extend this research by investigating whether these firms are more likely to lease their assests. Lessors' superior control rights allow them to provide capital to constrained firms with low-quality accounting reports. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that low accounting quality firms have a higher propensity to lease than purchase assets. To verify that leasing does not merely reflect these firms' desire for off-balance-sheet accounting, we investigate whether banks' access to private information and monitoring affect the relation between accounting quality and leasing. We find the association between accounting quality and leasing decreases when banks have higher monitoring incentives and when loans contain capital expenditure provisions. These results suggest that other mechanisms can substitute for the role of accounting quality in reducing information problems.},

We also find that companies audited by Big 6 auditors are able to make larger equity issues than are those audited by small auditors, but the difference narrows when market conditions improve. Additional results show that the debt ratios of companies decrease less in response to favorable market conditions when auditor quality is high, at least over the medium term.},

One role of accruals is to shift or adjust the recognition of cash flows over time so that the adjusted numbers (earnings) better measure firm performance. However, accruals require assumptions and estimates of future cash flows. We argue that the quality of accruals and earnings is decreasing in the magnitude of estimation error in accruals. We derive an empirical measure of accrual quality as the residuals from firm-specific regressions of changes in working capital on past, present, and future operating cash flows. We document that observable firm characteristics can be used as instruments for accrual quality (e.g., volatility of accruals and volatility of earnings). Finally, we show that our measure of accrual quality is positively related to earnings persistence.},

Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.  The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.  By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.  Web ResourceThe book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author’s website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

Economies of scale at the local level (number of yearly installations in a zip code) and at the installation level (size of the installation) are also associated with lower costs. Higher subsidies, and higher contractor market-share are associated with higher costs.

Winning and losing counties have similar trends in TFP prior to the new plant opening. Five years after the opening, incumbent plants' TFP is 12 percent higher in winning counties. This productivity spillover is larger for plants sharing similar labor and technology pools with the new plant. Consistent with spatial equilibrium models, labor costs increase in winning counties, indicating that profits ultimately increase less than productivity.},

In inference about possibly nonstationary dynamic models the usual asymptotic equivalence fails, however. We show with three-dimensional graphs how it is possible that in autoregressive models the distribution of the estimator is skewed asymptotically, while the likelihood and hence the posterior pdf remains symmetric. We show that no single prior can rationalize treating p-values as probabilities in these models, and we display examples of the sample-dependent "priors" that would do so. We argue that these results imply at a minimum that the usual test statistics and covariance matrices for autoregressions, which characterize the likelihood shape in dynamic models just as in static regression models, should be reported without any corrections for the special unit root distribution theory, even if the corrected classical p-values are reported as well.},

The appropriate choice of a prior is discussed. In recognizing a consensus distaste for explosive roots, I find the popular Normal-Wishart priors centered at the unit root to be reasonable provided they are modified by concentrating the prior mass for the time trend coefficient toward zero as the largest root approaches unit from below. I discuss that the tails of the predictive density can be sensitive to the prior treatment of explosive roots. Because the focus of an investigation often is on a particular persistence property or medium-term forecasting property of the data, I conclude that Bayesian methods often deliver natural answers to macroeconomic questions.},

We discuss key methodological issues in estimating causal relationships and largely focus on natural experiments that exploit variation in climate over time. Using a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to both estimate the mean effect and quantify the degree of variability across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase conflict risk. Contemporaneous temperature has the largest average impact, with each 1σ increase in temperature increasing interpersonal conflict by 2.4\% and intergroup conflict by 11.3\%. We conclude by highlighting research priorities, including a better understanding of the mechanisms linking climate to conflict, societies’ ability to adapt to climatic changes, and the likely impacts of future global warming.},

We decompose sources of error in predicting treatment effects in external contexts in terms of macro and micro sources of variation. In our empirical setting, we find that macro covariates dominate over micro covariates for reducing errors in predicting treatments, an issue that past studies of external validity have been unable to evaluate. We develop methods for two applications to evidencebased decision-making, including determining where to run the next experiment and whether policy-makers should commission new research or rely on an existing evidence base for making a policy decision.},

	abstract = {Explained variance (R2) is a familiar summary of the fit of a linear regression and has been generalized in various ways to multilevel (hierarchical) models. The multilevel models that we consider in this article are characterized by hierarchical data structures in which individuals are grouped into units (which themselves might be further grouped into larger units), and variables are measured on individuals and each grouping unit. The models are based on regression relationships at different levels, with the first level corresponding to the individual data and subsequent levels corresponding to between-group regressions of individual predictor effects on grouping unit variables. We present an approach to defining R2 at each level of the multilevel model, rather than attempting to create a single summary measure of fit. Our method is based on comparing variances in a single fitted model rather than with a null model. In simple regression, our measure generalizes the classical adjusted R2. We also discuss a related variance comparison to summarize the degree to which estimates at each level of the model are pooled together based on the level-specific regression relationship, rather than estimated separately. This pooling factor is related to the concept of shrinkage in simple hierarchical models. We illustrate the methods on a dataset of radon in houses within counties using a series of models ranging from a simple linear regression model to a multilevel varying-intercept, varying-slope model.},

Three main tools are illustrated: 1) graphical techniques for displaying sensitivity within an empirical Bayes framework, 2) simple simulation techniques for generating Bayesian posterior distributions of individual effects and the largest effect, and 3) methods for monitoring the adequacy of the Bayesian model specification by simulating the posterior predictive distribution in hypothetical replications of the same treatments in the same eight schools.},

It is hypothesized that the owner/manager seeks audits as compensatory control systems for the organizational loss of control inherent in hierarchical organizations. Thus, the expected value of wealth at risk due to loss of control sets a lower limit on the amount owners would be willing to pay for audits to compensate for that loss. The hypothesized relationship was tested using information for 103 private companies demanding audit (positive) assurance., The obtained relationships were basically unaltered by the introduction of lenders' requirement of audits (n = 40). Furthermore, the hypothesized compensatory aspect of audit assurance was absent for the demand for negative assurance (reviews) in a sample of 31 companies. This is consistent with the fact that negative assurance is not viewed as a way of providing confidence so as to compensate owners for loss of direct supervision and control.},

Specifically, we determine the factors associated with the production and use of financial statements for firms that have discretion in the preparation of financial statements and do not face the demands of public equity markets. In addition, for firms that prepare financial statements, we determine the factors associated with the sophistication of the financial statements in terms of whether the financials are compiled, reviewed, and/or audited by a professional accountant and whether the firm produces accrual‐based financial statements. Finally, we examine the potential benefits afforded firms producing financial statements, having audited financial statements, and having accrual‐based financial statements. We find that firms with audited financial statements benefit in the form of greater access to credit and that firms with accrual‐based financial statements benefit in the form of a lower cost of credit.},

	abstract = {This paper reports new survey results on the extent, sourcing and impact of external business advice to SMEs in Britain. The survey, covering 2547 respondents, is the largest and most definitive assessment to date. Its results demonstrate the very wide extent of external advice: used by 95\% of respondent SMEs, an increase from 85.8\% in a similar survey in 1991. The analysis of the survey assesses sources of advice in terms of the level of trust that exists between the supplier and the SME client. The market appears to be strongly segmented and dominated by high trust specialist sources (accountants, lawyers), customers, suppliers and business friends. Business associations and government-backed sources play an important but lesser role. The recent government initiative of Business Link has, however, established an important market, used by 27\% of respondents. Impact assessments confirm the significance of high trust private sector suppliers for the most crucial supplies of advice. Variations in use occur by SME type chiefly by size but also by sector and growth record. Generally levels of use vary by SME type to a greater extent than levels of impact.},

	abstract = {This study investigates voluntary demand for auditing by family businesses, a significant but relatively unexplored segment of the economy. The paper considers demand for both internal and external auditing by using survey data to investigate the impact of firm characteristics linked to the cost vs. benefit of engaging an auditor. Variables examined are firm size, debt, and two agency proxies that measure separation of ownership and control, namely, the proportion of nonfamily management in the firm, and the proportion of nonfamily representation on the board of directors. The paper also considers the association between internal and external auditing. Descriptive results on voluntary demand for auditing by 186 family businesses revealed that internal audit was more prevalent than external audit, and outsourcing was a common method for providing internal audit. Results from logistic regression analyses provide support for the hypothesized impact of the two agency proxies and firm debt on demand for external audit, but do not explain the demand for internal audit. For firms that voluntarily engaged an auditor (internal and/or external audit), the negative and significant correlation between internal and external audit suggest that in the family business environment they are more commonly viewed as substitute rather than complementary responses.},

While large scale business enterprise characterized by such a separation is dominant in the US, Japan and the UK, firms in which ownership and control is coupled in the hands of individuals and their families are apparent in many other large developed economies and are dominant in most emerging markets. This paper examines consequences regarding the generation and allocation of financial resources stemming from the coupling of ownership and control among Hong Kong based firms. In doing so, we join insights from the economics literature regarding the incentive and risk bearing consequences of coupled ownership and control with the extant management, sociology and history literatures regarding Chinese family business groups and develop and six hypotheses pertaining to patterns in the allocation of financial resources. Results indicate that coupled ownership and control is positively related with dividend payout levels and financial liquidity while it is negatively related to investments in capital expenditures. Consistent with these results, we also find that coupled ownership and control is positively related to short-term (accounting) profitability.},

It postulates that a major reason for firms to hire this service is to help control the conflict of interests among firm managers, shareholders, and bondholders. Firm characteristics which affect the severity of this conflict or the marginal cost of external auditing are expected to influence a firm's demand for this service. Based on this analysis, leverage, firm size, and number of accounting-based debt covenants are predicted to increase the probability that a firm will voluntarily hire external auditing. The firm manager's ownership share is predicted to have the opposite effect. Univariate and multivariate tests were conducted on a sample of 165 NYSE and OTC firms from the year 1926. The results generally supported the hypothesized effects of leverage and accounting-based debt covenants, and moderately supported the predicted role of firm size. Manager ownership effects could not be tested due to data problems.},

This paper is based on a survey of the directors of 385 companies conforming to the EC definition of ‘small’. The study investigates whether the three size criteria in company legislation (turnover, balance sheet total and number of employees) are appropriate and sufficient proxies for the demand for the audit by developing and testing a number of theoretical models. The results found that 63\% of companies would choose to have their accounts audited if they were exempt, which suggests that the majority of those affected by the proposed increase consider the benefits outweigh the costs. It was found that turnover alone could represent size, but that size was less important than the directors' perceptions of the value of the audit in terms of improving the quality of information and providing a check on internal records. Agency relationships with owners and lenders were also found to be significant influences on the demand for the audit in companies of the size studied.},

	abstract = {After a long period of universal mandatory audit, the UK reduced the regulatory burden of private firms by introducing size-based audit exemption in 1994; the size thresholds have subsequently been progressively increased. Both accounting bodies and credit-rating agencies (CRAs) have expressed reservations about this policy, arguing it could diminish user confidence in reported accounting numbers, and lead to a reduction in financial statement quality and credit ratings. Prior research, however, suggests that the managers of small UK companies do not perceive there to be an association between financial statement audit and firm credit score. To provide evidence of any effect on user confidence of making audit optional, we examine the credit scores and financial reporting quality of a large sample of UK private firms which qualified for audit exemption after major threshold changes in 2004. We find that, even though they report lower average profits, companies which retain a voluntary audit enjoy significantly higher credit scores than those which opt out of audit. The results of both conservatism and accruals-based tests indicate that opting out of audit is associated with less conservative financial reporting, consistent with the concerns of the accounting bodies and the CRAs, and providing an explanation for why opt-out firms report higher profits but receive lower credit scores. This study contributes to an important policy debate by providing large sample evidence that the audit does confer benefits to private firms in terms of financial reporting quality, assurance and the credit scores generated from the financial reports.},

The two functions usually attributed to the entrepreneur--management and risk bearing--are treated as naturally separate factors within the set of contracts called a firm. The firm is disciplined by competition from other firms, which forces the evolution of devides for efficiently monitoring the performance of the entire team and of its individual members.

Dividends provide evidence on this. Group-affiliated corporations in Europe pay higher dividends than in Asia, dampening insider expropriation.

Using behavioral theory, we argue that for family firms, the primary reference point is the loss of their socioemotional wealth, and to avoid those losses, family firms are willing to accept a significant risk to their performance; yet at the same time, they avoid risky business decisions that might aggravate that risk. Thus, we propose that the predictions of behavioral theory differ depending on family ownership. We confirm our hypotheses using a population of 1,237 family-owned olive oil mills in Southern Spain who faced the choice during a 54-year period of becoming a member of a cooperative, a decision associated with loss of family control but lower business risk, or remaining independent, which preserves the family's socioemotional wealth but greatly increases its performance hazard.

The first model predicts that stronger minority shareholder rights should be associated with higher dividend payouts; the second model predicts the opposite.

	abstract = {This explorative research paper draws evidence from a database of small to medium-size unquoted private companies (n = 240) in the UK and reports on the family business and venture capital relationship from the demand side. Following the review of literature relating to financial affairs of private companies, the main research inquiries are outlined and a set of generic hypotheses is elicited based on the pecking order theory—that is, private companies, including family-controlled ventures, have a propensity to finance their operations in a hierarchical fashion, first using internally available funds, followed by debt and, finally, external equity (Petitt \& Singer, 1985). Univariate statistical analyses confirm that family companies adhere strongly to the pecking order principles of financial development. The paper explores factors governing the rationale of owner-managing directors of private and family companies for considering venture capital dealings as well as main areas of concern about the deal structures. The paper then concludes with a discussion of the policy implications from the perspective of the owner-manager, financier, and enterprise policy maker. To encourage equity development of smaller privately held companies, particularly family firms, there is room for policy initiatives that respect the financial philosophy of private companies.},

This paper aims to                 explore the impact of the introduction of deregulation of the small company audit in                 the United Kingdom in 1994. It seeks to identify why small companies may still                 demand voluntary audits in the absence of a statutory requirement. Theoretical and                 economic factors and rationales affecting small company management choice to engage                 auditing are examined. Following a survey sent to small companies qualifying for                 audit exemption, several hypotheses underlying the demand for audits in an                 unregulated environment are empirically tested in a logistic regression model. Some                 support is found for the agency, or stewardship, hypotheses in small company choice                 to engage auditing.},

Results indicate family controlled firms employ higher dividend payout ratios, higher debt levels and lower levels of board independence compared to non-family firms. This suggests family controlled firms use either dividends or debt as a substitute for independent directors. We also find that dividends and debt are more effective governance mechanisms in mitigating the families’ expropriation of minority shareholders’ wealth. Independent directors are, in contrast, more effective in controlling owner-manager conflict in non-family firms.},

The tendency of a family CEO or family-dominated board to retain earnings appears to be stronger in earlier generational stages compared with later generational stages. The findings are consistent with (1) socioemotional objectives being important drivers of funding decisions in private firms where families possess important decision and control power and (2) these objectives being more predominant in early generational stages.},

Considering incentives of auditors to supply a high audit quality in private firms, we expect that Big 4 auditors have an incentive to constrain earnings management only in high tax alignment countries, where financial statements are more scrutinized by tax authorities and the probability that an audit failure is detected is higher.

Here we present examples of multivariate matching methods that will yield the same percent reduction in bias for each matching variable for a variety of underlying distributions. Eleven distributional cases are considered and for each one, matching methods are described which are equal percent bias reducing. The methods discussed in Section 8 will probably be the most generally applicable in practice.

Although often used to control for bias in studies in which randomization is practically impossible, there is virtually no statistical literature devoted to investigating the ability of matched sampling to control bias in the common case of many matching variables. An obvious problem in studying the multivariate matching situation is the variety of sampling plans, underlying distributions, and intuitively reasonable matching methods. This article considers one class of multivariate matching methods which yield the same percent reduction in expected bias for each of the matching variables. The primary result is the derivation of the expression for the maximum attainable percent reduction in bias given fixed distributions and fixed sample sizes. An examination of trends in this maximum leads to a procedure for estimating minimum ratios of sample sizes needed to obtain well-matched samples.},

However, since the quality of the resulting estimates may be sensitive to the adequacy of the underlying model, it is wise to search for nonparallelism and nonlinearity in these conditional expectations. Blocking on the values of X is also appropriate, although the quality of the resulting estimates may be sensitive to the coarseness of the blocking employed. In order for these techniques to be useful in practice, there must be either substantial overlap in the distribution of X in the treatment groups or strong prior information.},

	abstract = {Causal effects are comparisons among values that would have been observed under all possible assignments of treatments to experimental units. In an experiment, one assignment of treatments is chosen and only the values under that assignment can be observed. Bayesian inference for causal effects follows from finding the predictive distribution of the values under the other assignments of treatments. This perspective makes clear the role of mechanisms that sample experimental units, assign treatments and record data. Unless these mechanisms are ignorable (known probabilistic functions of recorded values), the Bayesian must model them in the data analysis and, consequently, confront inferences for causal effects that are sensitive to the specification of the prior distribution of the data. Moreover, not all ignorable mechanisms can yield data from which inferences for causal effects are insensitive to prior specifications. Classical randomized designs stand out as especially appealing assignment mechanisms designed to make inference for causal effects straightforward by limiting the sensitivity of a valid Bayesian analysis.},

Two frequently used methods are pooling the data or using fixed effects (an extreme version of which estimates separate models for each site). The former approach ignores site effects. The latter incorporates site effects but lacks a framework for predicting the impact of subsequent implementations of the program (e.g., would a new implementation resemble Riverside?). I present a hierarchical model that lies between these two extremes. Using data from the Greater Avenues for Independence demonstration, I demonstrate that the model captures much of the site-to-site variation of the treatment effects but has less uncertainty than estimating the treatment effect separately for each site. I also show that when predictive uncertainty is ignored, the treatment impact for the Riverside sites is significant, but when predictive uncertainty is considered, the impact for these sites is insignificant. Finally, I demonstrate that the model extrapolates site effects with reasonable accuracy when the site being predicted does not differ substantially from the sites already observed. For example, the San Diego treatment effects could have been predicted based on their site characteristics, but the Riverside effects are consistently underpredicted.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore Bayesian inference in models with many instrumental variables that are potentially weakly correlated with the endogenous regressor. The prior distribution has a hierarchical (nested) structure. We apply the methods to the Angrist-Krueger (AK, 1991) analysis of returns to schooling using instrumental variables formed by interacting quarter of birth with state/year dummy variables. Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995) show that randomly generated instrumental variables, designed to match the AK data set, give two-stage least squares results that look similar to the results based on the actual instrumental variables. Using a hierarchical model with the AK data, we find a posterior distribution for the parameter of interest that is tight and plausible. Using data with randomly generated instruments, the posterior distribution is diffuse. Most of the information in the AK data can in fact be extracted with quarter of birth as the single instrumental variable. Using artificial data patterned on the AK data, we find that if all the information had been in the interactions between quarter of birth and state/year dummies, then the hierarchical model would still have led to precise inferences, whereas the single instrument model would have suggested that there was no information in the data. We conclude that hierarchical modeling is a conceptually straightforward way of efficiently combining many weak instrumental variables.},

Contrary to the pro-competitive results of finite-horizon models, we find that the possibility of forward trading allows firms to sustain collusive profits that otherwise would not be possible to achieve. The result holds both for price and quantity competition and follows because (collusive) contracting of future sales is more effective in deterring deviations from the collusive plan than inducing the previously identified pro-competitive effects.},

firms are assumed to be indifferent across space. This condition implies that research
on cities is different from research on countries, and that work on places within
countries needs to consider population, income, and housing prices simultaneously.
Housing supply elasticity will determine whether urban success reveals itself in the
form of more people or higher incomes. Urban economists generally accept the existence
of agglomeration economies, which exist when productivity rises with density,
but estimating the magnitude of those economies is difficult. Some manufacturing
firms cluster to reduce the costs of moving goods, but this force no longer appears to
be important in driving urban success. Instead, modern cities are far more dependent
on the role that density can play in speeding the fl ow of ideas. Finally, urban
economics has some insights to offer related topics such as growth theory, national
income accounts, public economics, and housing prices. (JEL R11, R23, R31, R32)},

	abstract = {There is an extensive literature on the urbanization process looking at both urbanization and urban concentration, asking whether and when there is under or over-urbanization or under or over urban concentration. Writers argue that national government policies and non-democratic institutions promote excessive concentration—the extent to which the urban population of a country is concentrated in one or two major metropolitan areas—except in former planned economies where migration restrictions are enforced. These literatures assume that there is an optimal level of urbanization or an optimal level of urban concentration, but no research to date has quantitatively examined the assumption and asked the basic “so-what” question—how great are the economic losses from significant deviations from any optimal degrees of urban concentration or rates of urbanization? This paper shows that (1) there is a best degree of urban concentration, in terms of maximizing productivity growth (2) that best degree varies with the level of development and country size, and (3) over or under-concentration can be very costly in terms of productivity growth. The paper shows also that productivity growth is not strongly affected by urbanization per se. Rapid urbanization has often occurred in the face of low or negative economic growth over some decades. Moreover, urbanization is a transitory phenomenon where many countries are now fully urbanized.},

Single plant firms both benefit more from and generate greater external benefits than corporate plants, given their greater reliance on external environments.

A model in which localized industry‐specific spillovers, natural advantages, and pure random chance all contribute to geographic concentration is used to develop a test for whether observed levels of concentration are greater than would be expected to arise randomly and to motivate new indices of geographic concentration and of coagglomeration. The proposed indices control for differences in the size distribution of plants and for differences in the size of the geographic areas for which data are available. As a consequence, comparisons of the degree of geographic concentration across industries can be made with more confidence. Our empirical results provide a strong reaffirmation of the previous wisdom in that we find almost all industries to be somewhat localized. In many industries, however, the degree of localization is slight. We explore the nature of agglomerative forces in describing patterns of concentration, the geographic scope of localization, and the coagglomeration of related industries and of industries with strong upstream‐downstream ties.},

	abstract = {Search in an environment with an uncertain distribution of resources involves a trade-off between exploitation of past discoveries and further exploration. This extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker shifts between reading in depth and studying new domains. To study this decision-making process, we examine the reading choices made by one of the most celebrated scientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books listed in his chronologically-organized reading journals, we generate topic models to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading decisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a cognitively-validated, information-theoretic measure of relative surprise. Rather than a pattern of surprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin’s behavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually high levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts, detected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual epochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin’s own self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts with their publication order. We find Darwin’s consumption more exploratory than the culture’s production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal changes are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our quantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework for testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between short- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic modeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies of collective scientific behavior.},

Here we present a large-scale quantitative analysis of trial transcripts from the Old Bailey that reveal a major transition in the nature of this defining moment. By coarse-graining the spoken word testimony into synonym sets and dividing the trials based on indictment, we demonstrate the emergence of semantically distinct violent and nonviolent trial genres. We show that although in the late 18th century the semantic content of trials for violent offenses is functionally indistinguishable from that for nonviolent ones, a long-term, secular trend drives the system toward increasingly clear distinctions between violent and nonviolent acts. We separate this process into the shifting patterns that drive it, determine the relative effects of bureaucratic change and broader cultural shifts, and identify the synonym sets most responsible for the eventual genre distinguishability. This work provides a new window onto the cultural and institutional changes that accompany the monopolization of violence by the state, described in qualitative historical analysis as the civilizing process.},

	abstract = {We propose that the decision to pay dividends is driven by prevailing investor demand for dividend payers. Managers cater to investors by paying dividends when investors put a stock price premium on payers, and by not paying when investors prefer nonpayers. To test this prediction, we construct four stock price-based measures of investor demand for dividend payers. By each measure, nonpayers tend to initiate dividends when demand is high. By some measures, payers tend to omit dividends when demand is low. Further analysis confirms that these results are better explained by catering than other theories of dividends.},

But what goals would managers pursue? This paper uses variation in corporate governance generated by state adoption of antitakeover laws to empirically map out managerial preferences. We use plant‐level data and exploit a unique feature of corporate law that allows us to deal with possible biases associated with the timing of the laws. We find that when managers are insulated from takeovers, worker wages (especially those of white‐collar workers) rise. The destruction of old plants falls, but the creation of new plants also falls. Finally, overall productivity and profitability decline in response to these laws. Our results suggest that active empire building may not be the norm and that managers may instead prefer to enjoy the quiet life.},

Firms with higher financial reporting quality also are found to deviate less from predicted investment levels and show less sensitivity to macro-economic conditions.

Our findings indicate that maintaining the dividend level is on par with investment decisions, while repurchases are made out of the residual cash flow after investment spending. Perceived stability of future earnings still affects dividend policy as in Lintner (1956. American Economic Review 46, 97–113). However, 50 years later, we find that the link between dividends and earnings has weakened. Many managers now favor repurchases because they are viewed as being more flexible than dividends and can be used in an attempt to time the equity market or to increase earnings per share. Executives believe that institutions are indifferent between dividends and repurchases and that payout policies have little impact on their investor clientele. In general, management views provide little support for agency, signaling, and clientele hypotheses of payout policy. Tax considerations play a secondary role.},

	abstract = {We analyze a sample of 412 publicly listed Hong Kong firms during 1995–1998 in order to answer three questions. Does concentrated family ownership affect firm operating performance and value? Does it affect dividend policy? What is the impact of corporate governance on performance, value, and dividend payouts? Our results do not show a positive relationship between family ownership and return on assets, return on equity or the market-to-book ratio. In addition, we find a negative relationship between CEO duality and performance (where CEO duality is much more likely in family-controlled firms). We also find little relationship between family ownership and dividend policy. Only for small firms there is a significant negative relationship between dividend payouts and family ownership up to 10\% of the company's stock and a positive relationship for family ownership between 10 and 35\%. Dividend payouts in small firms also show little sensitivity to performance. Finally, the composition of the board of directors (proportion of independent non-executive directors, outsider-dominated board, presence of audit committees) has little impact on firm performance and dividend policy, particularly for small market capitalization firms. Our results for Hong Kong are in line with both Demsetz and Lehn (1985) [Demsetz, H., Lehn, K., 1985. The structure of corporate ownership: causes and consequences.

It postulates that a major reason for firms to hire this service is to help control the conflict of interests among firm managers, shareholders, and bondholders. Firm characteristics which affect the severity of this conflict or the marginal cost of external auditing are expected to influence a firm's demand for this service. Based on this analysis, leverage, firm size, and number of accounting-based debt covenants are predicted to increase the probability that a firm will voluntarily hire external auditing. The firm manager's ownership share is predicted to have the opposite effect. Univariate and multivariate tests were conducted on a sample of 165 NYSE and OTC firms from the year 1926. The results generally supported the hypothesized effects of leverage and accounting-based debt covenants, and moderately supported the predicted role of firm size.

	url = {http://www.nber.org/papers/w10599},
	abstract = {Why do firms pay dividends? If they didn't their asset and capital structures would eventually become untenable as the earnings of successful firms outstrip their investment opportunities. Had they not paid dividends, the 25 largest long-standing 2002 dividend payers would have cash holdings of \$1.8 trillion (51\% of total assets), up from \$160 billion (6\% of assets), and \$1.2 trillion in excess of their collective \$600 billion in long-term debt. Their dividend payments prevented significant agency problems since the retention of earnings would have given managers command over an additional \$1.6 trillion without access to better investment opportunities and with no additional monitoring. This logic suggests that firms with relatively high amounts of earned equity (retained earnings) are especially likely to pay dividends. Consistent with this view, the fraction of publicly traded industrial firms that pays dividends is high when the ratio of earned equity to total equity (total assets) is high, and falls with declines in this ratio, becoming near zero when a firm has little or no earned equity. We observe a highly significant relation between the decision to pay dividends and the ratio of earned equity to total equity or total assets,controlling for firm size, profitability, growth, leverage, cash balances, and dividend history. In our regressions, earned equity has an economically more important impact than does profitability or growth. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that firms pay dividends to mitigate agency problems.},

	abstract = {In the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, and Japan, the propensity to pay dividends is higher among larger, more profitable firms, and those for which retained earnings comprise a large fraction of total equity. Although there are hints of reductions in the propensity to pay dividends in most of the sample countries over the 1994–2002 period, they are driven by a failure of newly listed firms to initiate dividends when expected to do so. Dividend abandonment and the failure to initiate by existing nonpayers are economically unimportant except in Japan. Moreover, in each country, aggregate dividends have not declined and are concentrated among the largest, most profitable firms. Finally, outside of the US there is little evidence of a systematic positive relation between relative prices of dividend paying and non-paying firms and the propensity to pay dividends. Overall, these findings cast doubt on signaling, clientele, and catering explanations for dividends, but support agency cost-based lifecycle theories.},

Large firms will disclose more information since they benefit most. Disclosure also reduces the risk bearing capacity available through market makers. If initial information asymmetry is large, reducing it will increase the current price of the security. However, the maximum current price occurs with some asymmetry of information: further reduction of information asymmetry accentuates the undesirable effects of exit from market making.},

The two functions usually attributed to the entrepreneur--management and risk bearing--are treated as naturally separate factors within the set of contracts called a firm. The firm is disciplined by competition from other firms, which forces the evolution of devides for efficiently monitoring the performance of the entire team and of its individual members. Individual participants in the firm, and in particular its managers, face both the discipline and opportunities provided by the markets for their services, both within and outside the firm.},

	abstract = {This study tests the agency cost hypothesis in the context of geographic earnings disclosures. The agency cost hypothesis predicts that managers, when not monitored by shareholders, make self-maximizing decisions that may not necessarily be in the best interest of shareholders. These decisions include aggressively growing the firm, which reduces profitability and destroys firm value. Geographic earnings disclosures provide an interesting context to examine this issue. Beginning with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS 131), most U.S. multinational firms are no longer required to disclose earnings by geographic area (e.g., net income in Mexico or net income in East Asia). Such nondisclosure potentially reduces the ability of shareholders to monitor managers' decisions related to foreign operations. Using a sample of U.S. multinationals with substantial foreign operations, we find that nondisclosing firms, relative to firms that continue to disclose geographic earnings, experience greater expansion of foreign sales, produce lower foreign profit margins, and have lower firm value in the post–SFAS 131 period. Our conclusions are strengthened by the fact that these differences do not exist in the pre–SFAS 131 period and do not relate to domestic operations. We find differences in the predicted direction only for foreign operations and only after adoption of SFAS 131. Our results are robust to the inclusion of an extensive set of control variables related to alternative corporate governance mechanisms, operating performance, and the firm's information environment. Overall, the results are consistent with the agency cost hypothesis and the important role of financial disclosures in monitoring managers.},

Depending on the model used, relative percentage increases in the cost of equity capital average between 7 and 19\% in the month immediately following a restatement. The relative increase in the cost of capital dissipates as time passes and after controlling for analyst forecast biases, but continues to average between 6 and 15\% in the most conservative setting. We also show that restatements initiated by auditors are associated with the largest increase in the cost of capital, and that firms with greater leverage experience greater increases in their cost of capital. Overall, our evidence is consistent with accounting restatements lowering the perceived earnings quality of the firm and increasing investors' required rates of return.},

Ownership structure in Italy is highly concentrated and hence the relevant agency problem to analyse seems to be the one that arises from the conflicting interests of large shareholders and minority shareholders. This paper therefore attempts to test the rent extraction hypothesis by relating the firm’s dividend payout ratio to various ownership variables, which measure the degree of concentration in terms of the voting rights of large shareholders. The hypothesis that other non-controlling large shareholders may have incentives to monitor the largest shareholder is also tested. The results of the empirical analysis reveal that firms make lower dividend payouts as the voting rights of the largest shareholder increase.

We further account for the presence and identity of second large shareholders in family-controlled corporations. Overall, family firms pay out higher and more stable dividends to overcome agency problems with minority investors and to alleviate expropriation concerns. However, the higher dividend payments in these companies are mainly explained by the firms with no separation between the largest owner’s voting and cash flow rights. We also find that non-family second blockholders perform a monitoring role and induce owner families to distribute a higher proportion of their earnings as dividends. These results suggest that a family firm’s use of the dividend policy to alleviate minority shareholders’ concerns over wealth expropriation is primarily attributable to those companies with better corporate governance structures.},

After controlling for the effects of traditional economic, CEO entrenchment and ownership determinants of the propensity to pay dividends, I find evidence of a positive association between the propensity to pay and (i) board independence and (ii) director tenure, and a negative association between the propensity to pay and (i) busy directors and (ii) greater equity incentive compensation in the director pay structure. I find consistent results when the decision is to pay cash dividends or repurchase shares. In further tests, I find that equity incentive compensation in the independent director pay structure is the most pervasive determinant across other dividend measures such as dividend payout, total payout and repurchases. Overall, the findings suggest that the characteristics of independent directors are important determinants of the payout policy. The results also suggest that future corporate governance research could benefit from incorporating characteristics of independent directors rather than limiting governance measures to board independence especially when recent empirical evidence (Linck et al., 2008, 2009) shows convergence, and therefore, narrowing variation in the proportion of outsiders and insiders on a board.},

Moreover, the paper presents the first results for the UK, where the institutional framework and ownership structures are different from those of the US. Using a UK panel data set, the role of institutional ownership in association to dividend payout ratios is analysed within the context of the dividend models of Lintner [American Economic Review, 46 (1956) 97], Waud [Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1996] and Fama and Babiak [Journal of the American Statistical Association, 63 (1968) 1132]. The results consistently produce strong support for the hypothesis that a positive association exists between dividend payout policy and institutional ownership. Furthermore, the results for an earnings trend model suggest a positive earnings trend component to the association between institutional ownership and the dividend payout ratio. In addition, there is some evidence in support of the hypothesis that a negative association exists between dividend payout policy and managerial ownership.},

Based on an exhaustive sample of 235 publications, this article provides a comprehensive review and a critical assessment of the theoretical underpinnings and corporate governance issues in family business research. Three predominant theoretical perspectives, namely principal–agent theory, stewardship theory and the resource-based view of the firm, have emerged and provide empirical evidence that family businesses significantly differ from non-family firms in important dimensions such as agency costs, competitive advantages or corporate governance structure. On their own, none of the aforementioned perspectives succeeds in addressing all complexities associated with family businesses and their corporate governance. Accordingly, joint approaches combining different theoretical frameworks can help to improve understanding of the family business. The article concludes by discussing possible directions for future research that might further contribute to building a comprehensive theory of the family business and its corporate governance.},

Although principal–agent conflicts may be less prevalent in such firms, family control can potentially give rise to principal–principal conflicts, leading to expropriation of the wealth of minority owners by family owners. Superior firm performance and the willingness to distribute the profits through dividend payments would suggest the absence of such expropriation. Based on a sample of 210 OTC firms in Japan, we examined the relationships between family control and dividend payouts and profitability. Our results indicate that family control was positively related to dividend payouts. Further, we found that while foreign ownership interacted with family control to reduce dividend payouts and increase profitability, bank ownership did not have such an effect.},

An equilibrium model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required.

In this groundbreaking text, two world-renowned experts present statistical methods for studying such questions. This book starts with the notion of potential outcomes, each corresponding to the outcome that would be realized if a subject were exposed to a particular treatment or regime. In this approach, causal effects are comparisons of such potential outcomes. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can only observe one of the potential outcomes for a particular subject. The authors discuss how randomized experiments allow us to assess causal effects and then turn to observational studies. They lay out the assumptions needed for causal inference and describe the leading analysis methods, including, matching, propensity-score methods, and instrumental variables. Many detailed applications are included, with special focus on practical aspects for the empirical researcher.},

We show that in a first-price auction, level-k bidding changes the optimal reserve price and often yields expected revenue that exceeds Myerson’s (1981) bound; and that an exotic auction that exploits bidders’ non-equilibrium beliefs can far exceed the revenue bound. We close with some general observations about level-k auction design.},

	abstract = {This study examines how financial reporting quality affects corporate dividend policy. We find that higher quality reporting is associated with higher dividends. This positive association is more pronounced among firms with more severe free cash flow problems and among firms with higher ownership by monitoring-type institutional investors. Further analysis of the relation between reporting quality and under−/over-payment of dividends suggests that reporting quality largely mitigates underpayment of dividends. Additionally, both a granger causality test and a difference-in-difference analysis of dividend changes around a quasi-exogenous reporting event yield evidence consistent with the direction of causality going from financial reporting to dividends. Overall, these findings are consistent with financial reporting quality acting as a governance mechanism that induces managers to pay dividends by disciplining free cash flow problems. Our findings support the view that dividends are the result of enhanced monitoring (Jensen 1986; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny 2000).},

This paper defines and applies a new equilibrium concept in games with private information, cursed equilibrium, which assumes that each player correctly predicts the distribution of other players' actions, but underestimates the degree to which these actions are correlated with other players' information. We apply the concept to common-values auctions, where cursed equilibrium captures the widely observed phenomenon of the winner's curse, and to bilateral trade, where cursedness predicts trade in adverse-selections settings for which conventional analysis predicts no trade. We also apply cursed equilibrium to voting and signalling models. We test a single-parameter variant of our model that embeds Bayesian Nash equilibrium as a special case and find that parameter values that correspond to cursedness fit a broad range of experimental datasets better than the parameter value that corresponds to Bayesian Nash equilibrium.},

The method is to combine a small geophysical model of the GIS with the DICE integrated assessment model. The result shows that the GIS is likely to disappear over the next millennium or so without climate policy, but an active climate policy may prevent the GIS from crossing the threshold of irreversibility. Additionally, the study estimates the impact of the GIS on the social cost of carbon (SCC) and finds that adding GIS dynamics would add less than 5\% to the SCC under alternative discount rates and estimates of the GIS dynamics. Simulations of geo-engineering options indicate that the dynamics of disintegration and rebuilding are extremely asymmetric, implying that GIS disintegration should be treated as irreversible.},

The extension endogenizes the dividend (and financing) announcement effects amply documented in recent research. But once trading of shares is admitted to the model along with asymmetric information, the familiar Fisherian criterion for optimal investment becomes time inconsistent: the market's belief that the firm is following the Fisher rule creates incentives to violate the rule. We show that an informationally consistent signalling equilibrium exists under asymmetric information and the trading of shares that restores the time consistency of investment policy, but leads in general to lower levels of investment than the optimum achievable under full information and/or no trading. Contractual provisions that change the information asymmetry or the possibility of profiting from it could eliminate both the time inconsistency and the inefficiency in investment policies, but these contractual provisions too are likely to involve dead-weight costs.

This literature review is conducted based on published articles during the period 1976-2013 in nine leading journals related to auditing. We organize our review around four main threats to auditor independence, namely, (a) client importance, (b) non-audit services, (c) auditor tenure, and (d) client affiliation with audit firms. For each of the threats, we discuss findings related to the incentives, perceptions, and behaviors of the auditor and the client, as well as the effects of each threat on the actual and perceived quality of audits and financial reports. We conclude that the mixed evidence, together with recent regulatory changes, provides opportunities for future research on auditor independence and audit quality.},

We analyze the macroeconomic effects of these financial policies throughout the three phases and provide the stylized facts to substantiate our analysis. The stylized facts differ qualitatively across different phases or economies. We argue that the impacts of China’s financial policies work through transmission channels different from those in developed economies and that a regime switch from one economy to another was driven mainly by regime changes in financial policies.},

We use German firm-level data from the high-tech manufacturing sector to estimate a dynamic structural model of a firm's decision to invest in R\&D and use it to measure the difference in expected long-run benefit from R\&D investment for exporting and domestic firms. The results show that R\&D investment leads to a higher rate of product and process innovation among exporting firms and these innovations have a larger impact on productivity improvement in export market sales. As a result, exporting firms have a higher payoff from R\&D investment, invest in R\&D more frequently than firms that only sell in the domestic market, and, subsequently, have higher rates of productivity growth. The endogenous investment in R\&D is an important mechanism that leads to a divergence in the long-run performance of firms that differ in their export market exposure. Simulating the introduction of trade tariffs we find a substantial reduction in firms' productivity growth and incentive to invest in R\&D.},

This paper aims at quantifying the role of international trade in attenuating the effects of climate change by allowing the expression of the new climate-induced pattern of comparative advantages. To do this, we develop a quantitative general equilibrium trade model where the representation of acreage and land use choices is inspired from modern Ricardian trade models but also consistent with theoretical and empirical literature on land use choices. The model is calibrated on spatially explicit information about potential yields before and after climate change coming from the agronomic literature. The results show that the climate-induced yield changes generate large price movements that incentivize adjustments in acreage and trade. The new trade pattern is very different from the current one, showing the important role of trade flows in adapting to climate change. This is confirmed by larger welfare losses from climate change when adjustments in trade flows are constrained versus when they are not.},

This paper seeks to understand the implications of these developments for the broader economy and monetary policy. To that end, we develop a novel general equilibrium model featuring heterogeneous banks, interbank markets for both secured and unsecured credit, and a central bank. The model features a number of occasionally binding constraints. The interactions between these constraints - in particular leverage and liquidity constraints - are key in determining macroeconomic outcomes. We find that both secured and unsecured money market frictions force banks to either divert resources into unproductive but liquid assets or to de-lever, which leads to less lending and output. If the liquidity constraint is very tight, the leverage constraint may turn slack. In this case, there are large declines in lending and output. We show how central bank policies which increase the size of the central bank balance sheet can attenuate this decline.},

However, most of this literature focuses on the retail sector where banks obtain deposits from households. In fact, the recent financial crisis that triggered the Great Recession featured a disruption of wholesale funding markets, where banks lend to one another. Accordingly, to understand the financial crisis as well as to draw policy implications, it is essential to capture the role of wholesale banking. The objective of this chapter is to characterize a model that can be seen as a natural extension of the existing literature, but in which the analysis is focused on wholesale funding markets. The model accounts for both the buildup and collapse of wholesale banking and also sketches out the transmission of the crises to the real sector. We also draw out the implications of possible instability in the wholesale banking sector for lender-of-last resort policy as well as for macroprudential policy.},

It is shown that this joint distribution reduces in the single site case to a wind speed distribution closely approximating the widely used Weibull; the multiple site power distribution is also shown to fit adequately to data on wind speeds from four sites in Western Australia. Results presented in graphical and tabular form for a range of representative cases show that a significant reduction in the variability of total wind power output may result from dispersion of aerogenerator sites; a quantitative guide to the magnitude of these effects is also provided.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a quantile association regression model, which is able to capture the dynamic quantile dependence in the tails of conditional distributions. The association measure, the quantile-specific odds ratio (qor), captures the tendency of two random variables being simultaneously below specific quantiles. It is independent of marginal distributions and invariant to monotonic transformation, and enjoys methodological advantages over popular alternatives such as the copula. The ability of the qor measure to capture and forecast a range of different dependence structures is first shown via simulations. In the financial application, we implement the model and compute the qor on a daily basis to assess contagion for 10 stock markets during two recent crises. Our empirical results show that contagion exists during the US banking crisis between the US and all tested markets and between Greece and the tested European markets during the Euro crisis. Hence the model is able to capture the changes in quantile dependence between stock markets and offer a vivid description of market events. In addition, the model provides an accurate valuation of daily value-at-risk (VaR).},

This paper considers the probabilistic forecasting of a ramp event, defined as exceedance beyond a specified threshold. We directly model the exceedance probability using autoregressive logit models fitted to the change in wind power. These models can be estimated by maximising a Bernoulli likelihood. We introduce a model that simultaneously estimates the ramp event probabilities for different thresholds using a multinomial logit structure and categorical distribution. To model jointly the probability of ramp events at more than one wind farm, we develop a multinomial logit formulation, with parameters estimated using a bivariate Bernoulli distribution. We use a similar approach in a model for jointly predicting one and two steps-ahead. We evaluate post-sample probability forecast accuracy using hourly wind power data from four wind farms.},

	abstract = {Wind power has seen strong growth over the last decade and increasingly affects electricity spot prices. In particular, prices are more volatile due to the stochastic nature of wind, such that more generation of wind energy yields lower prices. Therefore, it is important to assess the value of wind power at different locations not only for an investor but for the electricity system as a whole. In this paper, we develop a stochastic simulation model that captures the full spatial dependence structure of wind power by using copulas, incorporated into a supply and demand based model for the electricity spot price. This model is calibrated with German data. We find that the specific location of a turbine – i.e., its spatial dependence with respect to the aggregated wind power in the system – is of high relevance for its value. Many of the locations analyzed show an upper tail dependence that adversely impacts the market value. Therefore, a model that assumes a linear dependence structure would systematically overestimate the market value of wind power in many cases. This effect becomes more important for increasing levels of wind power penetration and may render the large-scale integration into markets more difficult.},

Therefore, it is important to assess the value of wind power at different locations not only for an investor but for the electricity system as a whole. In this paper, we develop a stochastic simulation model that captures the full spatial dependence structure of wind power by using copulas, incorporated into a supply and demand based model for the electricity spot price. This model is calibrated with German data. We find that the specific location of a turbine – i.e., its spatial dependence with respect to the aggregated wind power in the system – is of high relevance for its value. Many of the locations analyzed show an upper tail dependence that adversely impacts the market value. Therefore, a model that assumes a linear dependence structure would systematically overestimate the market value of wind power in many cases. This effect becomes more important for increasing levels of wind power penetration and may render the large-scale integration into markets more difficult.},

	abstract = {Large scale integration of wind energy poses new challenges to the European power system due to its stochastic nature and often remote location. In this paper a multivariate uncertainty analysis problem is formulated for the integration of stochastic wind energy in the European grid. By applying copula theory a synthetic set of data is generated from scarce wind speed reanalysis data in order to achieve the increased sample size for the subsequent Monte Carlo simulation. In the presented case study, European wind power samples are generated from the modeled stochastic process. Under the precondition of a modeled perfect market environment, wind power impacts dispatch decisions and therefore leads to alterations in power balances. Stochastic power balances are implemented in a detailed model of the European electricity network, based on the generated samples. Finally, a Monte Carlo method is used to determine power flows and contingencies in the system. An indicator is elaborated in order to analyze risk of overloading and to prioritize necessary grid reinforcements. Implications for the Swiss power grid are investigated in detail, revealing that the current system is significantly put at risk in certain areas by the further integration of wind power in Europe. It is the first time that the results of a probabilistic model for wind energy are further deployed within a power system analysis of the interconnected European grid. The method presented in this paper allows to account for stochastic wind energy in a load flow analysis and to evaluate deterministic indicators, such as the N−1 criterion, on a probabilistic basis. Thus, it constitutes an important extension of deterministic models.},

In a symmetric information setting, delayed contracting is unambiguously beneficial. Abandoning the once established relation with the entrant supplier is never an issue. In contrast, under asymmetric information hurried contracting with potentially abandoning the relation can be beneficial. Consistent with adverse selection models, we find that under delayed contracting, in equilibrium, the firm switches less frequently to the entrant supplier (switching inertia). Surprisingly, we also find that under hurried contracting the firm switches more frequently to the entrant supplier (switching acceleration) and may abandon the relation. Finally, we study how these key variables of the supplier switching process change when also the incumbent supplier has private information (two-sided asymmetric information case).},

We explore an instalment payment (contract) consisting of an initial payment to the supplier as soon as the product is put in use, followed by a deferred payment that is contingent upon the product in normal operation within a certain period. We find that when the high quality supplier has a higher cost than the low quality supplier, and the suppliers’ financing costs are lower than a certain threshold, the optimal instalment payment has two options: an initial-payment-only option preferred by the low quality supplier and a deferred-payment-only option preferred by the high quality supplier; otherwise, the optimal contract degenerates into an initial-payment-only option. Thus, our research complements past work on moral hazard where no initial payment is proposed. Moreover, we show that the buyer has an incentive to assist with the supplier’s financing. Finally, we compare the instalment payment with the rental contract and show that when the supplier’s financing cost is low or the quality difference among different supplier types is small, the rental contract is more likely to be preferred by the buyer than the instalment payment.},

A hyperprior distribution on the mixing parameters is considered and a procedure based on the expected Kullback–Leibler divergence is proposed to analytically calculate the hyperparameter values. Next, the experts’ prior beliefs are calibrated with respect to the combined posterior belief over the quantity of interest by using expected Kullback–Leibler divergences, which are estimated with a computationally low-cost method. Finally, it is remarkable that the proposed approach can be easily applied in practice, as it is shown with an application.},

Good governance approximately doubles this value. Furthermore, we show that firms with poor corporate governance dissipate cash quickly in ways that significantly reduce operating performance.

Our results imply dividends reduce audit risk by enhancing clients' earnings quality information.

In this study, we test this conjecture by comparing the dividend policies of firms accused of accounting fraud to those of firms not accused of accounting fraud. Specifically, we examine whether alleged fraud firms are as likely to be dividend payers as non-fraud firms, and whether managers of dividend-paying fraud firms increase dividends at the same rate as managers of non-fraud firms. Our data reveal that dividend paying status is negatively associated with the probability of committing accounting fraud. In addition, we also find that, during the alleged fraud period, the earnings–dividends relation is weaker for the alleged fraud firms relative to firms not accused of fraud. Finally, using propensity score match tests, the data provide evidence that managers of alleged fraud firms increase dividends less often than managers of firms not accused of fraud, consistent with the alleged fraud firms not being able to match the dividend policies of firms not accused of fraud. Overall, our results suggest that dividends, especially dividend increases, are associated with higher earnings quality.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the impact of public research and development (R\&D) support on cost reducing innovation for wind turbine farms in Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom (UK). First we survey the literature in this field. The literature indicates that in Denmark R\&D policy has been more successful than in Germany or the UK in promoting innovation of wind turbines. Furthermore, such studies point out that (subsidy-induced) capacity expansions were more effective in the UK and Denmark in promoting cost-reducing innovation than in Germany. The second part of the paper describes the quantitative analysis of the impact of R\&D and capacity expansion on innovation. This is calculated using the two-factor learning curve (2FLC) model, in which investment cost reductions are explained by cumulative capacity and the R\&D based knowledge stock. Time-series data were collected for the three countries and organized as a panel data set. The parameters of the 2FLC model were estimated, focusing on the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the parameters across countries. We arrived at robust estimations of a learning-by-doing rate of 5.4\% and a learning-by-searching rate of 12.6\%. The analysis underlines the homogeneity of the learning parameters, enhancing the validity of the 2FLC formulation.},

It identifies and contrasts an impatient supporter with an idealistic supporter discourse. These differ in content, in constituents and in time of use. Second, it identifies an absolute opposition and qualified opposition discourse. Neither of these discourses confirm an expectation from previous studies that landscape and place attachment are the primary determinants for wind energy opposition, rather concerns over health risks, wildlife habitat and a rebuttal of the climate benefits of wind energy are of key concern.

	abstract = {One of the challenges managers face when trying to understand complex, technological systems (in their efforts to mitigate system risks) is the quantification of accident probability, particularly in the case of rare events. Once this risk information has been quantified, managers and decision makers can use it to develop appropriate policies, design projects, and/or allocate resources that will mitigate risk. However, rare event risk information inherently suffers from a sparseness of accident data. Therefore, expert judgment is often elicited to develop frequency data for these high-consequence rare events. When applied appropriately, expert judgment can serve as an important (and, at times, the only) source of risk information. This paper presents a Bayesian methodology for assessing relative accident probabilities and their uncertainty using paired comparison to elicit expert judgments. The approach is illustrated using expert judgment data elicited for a risk study of the largest passenger ferry system in the US.},

In this paper, we provide a method to measure the overall uncertainty while simultaneously reducing the influence of simulation estimation error due to output variability. To reach this goal, a Bayesian framework is introduced. We use a Bayesian posterior for the input-model parameters, conditional on the real-world data, to quantify the input-parameter uncertainty; we propagate this uncertainty to the output mean using a Gaussian process posterior distribution for the simulation response as a function of the input-model parameters, conditional on a set of simulation experiments. We summarize overall uncertainty via a credible interval for the mean. Our framework is fully Bayesian, makes more effective use of the simulation budget than other Bayesian approaches in the stochastic simulation literature, and is supported with both theoretical analysis and an empirical study. We also make clear how to interpret our credible interval and why it is distinctly different from the confidence intervals for input uncertainty obtained in other papers.},

The mixture cure model, one important branch of survival models, is also applied in the context of credit scoring, assuming that the study population is a mixture of never-default and will-default customers. We extend the standard mixture cure model through: (1) relaxing the independence assumption of the probability and the time of default; (2) treating the missing defaulting labels as latent variables and applying an augmentation technique; and (3) introducing a discrete truncated exponential distribution to model the time of default. Our full model is written in a hierarchical form so that the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is applied to estimate corresponding parameters. Through an empirical analysis, we show that both mixture models, the standard mixture cure model and the hierarchical mixture cure model (HMCM), are more advanced in identifying future defaulters while compared with logistic regression. It is also concluded that our hierarchical Bayesian extension increases the model’s predictability and provides meaningful output for risk management.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the spatial representation of market structure calibrated on actual or intended choice data. Previous models developed for that purpose accommodate consumer heterogeneity by estimating parameters for each consumer, typically using the method of maximum likelihood. This approach to heterogeneity avoids assuming any particular distribution of the individual level parameters across the sample, but leads to problems related to the consistency of the estimates, sufficient degrees of freedom, and the validity of asymptotic standard errors and test statistics. Of greater concern is the assumption of independence of the choice observations within the same individual. This assumption is necessary in a maximum likelihood (MLE) framework to make the estimation computationally feasible. However, the marketing and psychology literature (cf. Manrai, 1995; Tversky and Simonson, 1993; Kim et al., forth coming) demonstrates that dependencies among choice alternatives may exist, and negligence to take such covariance into account may lead to inconsistent estimates, reduced predictive validity, and incorrect managerial action. We develop a new multidimensional scaling (MDS) model that estimates spatial market structures from pick-any/J choice data, provides for individual level parameters, and allows for correlations among the choice alternatives across individuals. We provide a Bayesian estimation method that overcomes the traditional problems associated with estimating models with such correlated alternatives. We provide an application to pick-any/J data for various brands of portable telephones. In a comparative analysis, we show that the proposed model outperforms one in which the utilities are assumed to be uncorrelated across choice alternatives.},

The solution of these problems involves a dynamic programming formulation and backward induction. We present a simulation-based method to solve these problems adopting an approach which replaces the preposterior analysis by a surface fitting based optimization approach. We provide examples to illustrate the implementation of our approach.},
