#Try:

-only do descale transformation (no log)
-let b_s also be random (let mu_b_s be dependent on all the other variables)
=======
Check: host sector or owner sector: should be host sector
Add county data
Do posterior predictive check

Idea: What is the relationship between quality and price.
Has quality improved over time?
Does manufacturing explain anything.

Theory: Since leasing systems don`t have the same agent problem, they
will use better components and have less ware over time.

Should I really log transform it and then descale?

Use signal to noise ratio like in Korteweg?

I don't think it makes sense to use log transformed data?
